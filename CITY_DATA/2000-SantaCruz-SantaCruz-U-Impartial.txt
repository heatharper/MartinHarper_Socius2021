Impartial Analysis by City Attorney

This ballot measure, if adopted by City voters, would amend the Santa Cruz Municipal Code by raising the transient occupancy tax rate from the current rate of 10 percent to 12 percent. The transient occupancy tax is a tax paid by hotel and motel guests who spend fewer than 30 consecutive days in a hotel or motel in the City. The tax is on the room rent paid. For example, a hotel guest currently pays $10.00 tax per night on a $100.00 hotel room. If the ballot measure is adopted, the hotel guest would pay $12.00 tax per night on a $100.00 hotel room. The ballot measure would further require the City to dedicate the tax revenue received by the City as a result of the tax rate increase to the funding of nonprofit homeless service providers for the provision of shelter services, including the establishment of a permanent year-round shelter with appropriate facilities for homeless families and children. In other words, 2/12 (16.6 percent) of the revenues generated by the transient occupancy tax would be used to underwrite services for homeless persons. 10/12 of the revenue (83.4 percent) would be deposited in the City’s General Fund and General Capital Improvement Fund and used by the City for the provision of municipal services to its residents and for the construction and maintenance of capital improvements. Currently 100 percent of transient occupancy tax revenues, computed at the rate of ten percent, are dedicated to the City’s General Fund and General Capital Improvement Fund. Because the proposed transient occupancy tax rate increase would be imposed for a specific purpose, the underwriting of homeless services, the ballot measure proposes a "special tax" as defined by Article XIIIC of the California Constitution. Accordingly, for the ballot measure to be adopted, it must receive a two-thirds "yes" vote.
