CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF PROPOSITION Q

Avalon’s base rate business license tax was increased from $75 to $93.75 in 1972
and has remain unchanged since then. In 1995-96, the City collected $81,585 in
business license tax revenues. If Measure Q is approved, the base tax rate charged
for a business license will increase by $26.25 (or 12.8%) to $120, generating
estimated additional revenues of $37,000. Currently, business license taxes are the
same for transient unit rentals (rentals of 30 days or less) and non-transient unit
rentals (rentals of 31 days or more). If Measure Q is approved, the owner of a
unit which is rented non-transiently during the entire licensing period may apply
for and receive a rebate of business license; taxes over and above the current tax
rate.

The fiscal impact of Measure Q depends upon whether Avalon voters approve
Measure O or Measure P. If both Measure O and Measure P fail, then all business
license tax revenues, including the increase proposed by Measure Q, will go to
the Chamber of Commerce to be used for promotion and marketing. If Measure
O is approved, all business license tax revenue, including the increase proposed
by Measure Q, will go into the City’s General Services fund, to be used for street
cleaning, tree trimming, police and fire protection, planning and building and
similar general services. If Measure P-is approved, then the City’s General
Services fund and the Chamber of Commerce will receive an equal share of
business license tax revenue, including the increase proposed by Measure Q.
