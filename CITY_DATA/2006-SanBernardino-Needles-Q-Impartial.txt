MEASURE “Q”
IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS

Measure Q proposes to raise revenue to fund necessary capital improvements to the
City’s utility enterprises by authorizing a one-quarter of one percent (0.25%)
supplementation to the existing retail sales tax within the City of Needles. The tax
would be in addition to current State and local sales taxes and would be collected at
the same time and in the same manner as those existing taxes.

If Measure Q is approved, all funds collected pursuant to this Measure will be
deposited into a restricted account which can only be used for capital improvements to
the City’s utility enterprises. The State Board of Equalization shall administer all funds
collected through Measure Q, which shall remain in effect for a period of ten (10)
years, beginning at the commencement of collection of this tax by the State Board of
Equalization, and then shall automatically terminate.

At its July 26, 2006 adjourned regular meeting, the City Council of the City of Needles
adopted Ordinance No. 485-AC proposing Measure Q and Resolution No. 7-25-06-2
submitting the Measure to a vote of the electors of the City. A “Yes” vote by a two-
thirds majority voting on Measure Q is a vote to approve and allow the City to
supplement the current retail sales tax by one-quarter of one percent (0.25%). A “No”
vote on Measure Q would maintain the sales tax at its current rate of seven and three-
quarters percent (7.75 %).
