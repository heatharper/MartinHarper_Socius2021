IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE Q

Initiative Measure to Be Submitted Directly to the Voters

The city attorney has prepared the following title and summary of the chief
purpose and points of the proposed measure:

Initiative to Repeal All Assessments on Real Property Within the City of
Torrance for Municipal Lighting, Including the Assessment for City of Torrance
Lighting District No. 99-1, Starting the First Fiscal Year Following Passage of
this Initiative and All Subsequent Fiscal Years

On June 15, 1999, the City formed an assessment district under the Landscaping
and Lighting Act of 1972, designated as “City of Torrance Lighting District
No. 99-1” (“the District”). The City formed the District to pay for the ongoing
maintenance and servicing of streetlights, safety lights and traffic signals in the
City of Torrance. The City of Torrance levied assessments for fiscal year
1999/2000.

The proposed measure would repeal all assessments on real property within the
City for municipal lighting including the assessment for City of Torrance
Lighting District No. 99-1, starting the first year following passage of this
initiative and all subsequent fiscal years.
