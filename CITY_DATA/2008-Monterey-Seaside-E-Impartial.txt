Impartial Analysis from The City Attorney
The initiative measure proposes to repeal the City of Seaside's Municipal Code Chapter

3.30	entitled "Utility Tax Law of the City" July 1, 2009.

Chapter 3.30 currently places a utility user tax on persons who receive and pay for
electricity, gas, telephone, water and cable television service within the City with the
exception of persons sixty-five years of age or older or persons with a qualified
disability. The tax is a percentage of the charges for these utilities and is currently
assessed at the rate of 6%. Revenue from the tax is currently used for the general
governmental purposes of the City of Seaside.

If this measure is approved by voters, the tax will be repealed effective July 1, 2009.
Approval of the measure will result in reducing the amount of revenue available to the
City for general government purposes.
