IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE P

The City Council of the City of Burlingame placed this measure on the
ballot to determine whether the increase in the general business license tax
rate from $50 per year to $100 per year that was first adopted by the City in
1992 should be continued. The general business license tax is charged to
each business conducting business in the City of Burlingame with some
narrow exceptions that are specified in the Municipal Code.

The City estimates that the tax increment between $50 per year and
$100 per year generates approximately $230,000 per year, which goes into
the City’s general fund for general government purposes, including capital
improvements, in the City. The tax is collected through the annual business
license process.

Because under the proposed measure, the tax revenue would be put into
the City’s general fund for general City government purposes, a majority
vote of the City’s voters voting in this election is required to approve the
measure. Because the tax would be adopted by a vote of the people, the tax
rate could not be increased except by another vote of the people.
