CITY OF CLOVIS TRANSIENT OCCUPANCY TAX
MEASURE B
(Impartial Analysis by City Attorney)

The Clovis Municipal Code provides for the collection of transient occupancy taxes. Transient occupancy
taxes are taxes collected for the City by hotel operators upon the occupancy of a hotel room for thirty (30)
consecutive days or less. A hotel is broadly defined to include all buildings designed for dwelling, lodging
or sleeping purposes and includes, but is not limited to, any hotel, inn, motel, lodging house, rooming house,
apartment house, dormitory and mobile home at a fixed location. The taxes collected are placed in the Cityâ€™s
General Fund which can be used for general municipal purposes. The existing tax rate, which has been in
effect since 1964, is four (4%) percent of the room rent charged by the operator and is paid by the occupant.
If Measure B passes, the tax rate will be increased to ten (10%) percent.
