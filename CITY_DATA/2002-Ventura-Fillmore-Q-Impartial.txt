CITY OF FILLMORE CITY ATTORNEYâ€™S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS MEASURE "Q"	


The City Council of the City of Fillmore ("City") proposes to purchase the existing swimming pool property, located on the Fillmore High School campus, 555 Central Avenue, Fillmore, California, from the Fillmore Unified School District and construct a new swimming pool on the property. The stated purpose of the Ordinance is to impose a special tax of Fifteen Dollars ($15.00) per year per parcel for swimming pool maintenance costs. The tax will be imposed annually unless the City Council determines by June 30 before the next fiscal year not to impose the tax for that fiscal year.	

The tax rate cannot exceed the maximum established by the Ordinance without the approval of a two-thirds (2/3) vote of the electors of the City of Fillmore. If the voters do not approve the Ordinance, the City will not purchase the existing swimming pool property or build a new swimming pool.
