IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
CITY OF CARMEL-BY-THE-SEA
SPECIAL TAX MEASURE B

The City of Carmel-by-the-Sea (“City") has proposed a ballot measure
to establish a Special Parcel Tax for the provision of emergency medical
services within the City’s boundaries.

The measure proposes to authorize the City to assess a special parcel
tax on all real property within the City each year, in an amount not
to exceed an annual maximum of $3.75 per unit of benefit. A unit of
benefit per parcel is determined in accordance with a formula provided
by the Monterey County Assessor.

The actual amount of tax to be assessed each parcel every year
shall be determined by the City Council prior to July 1 of each
year; however, the amount may not exceed $75 per single family
dwelling and $37.50 for vacant lots, and shall be proportionately
more for other classifications of real property, excluding property
owned by governmental agencies. The tax would be billed by the
County on behalf of the City as part of a property owner’s property
tax each year.

Funds derived from the Special Parcel Tax may only be used for the
purposes of obtaining, furnishing, operating, and maintaining
emergency medical services. Costs can include paying for the salaries
and benefits of paramedic and Emergency Medical Technician
personnel, and other necessary paramedic service expenses of the
City, including purchase of necessary equipment not otherwise
adequately funded by the Monterey County Emergency Medical
Services System.

A "yes" vote on the measure would authorize the City to impose a
Special Parcel Tax beginning July 1,1998. A"no" vote on the measure
would deny the Special Parcel Tax. Approval by two-thirds of the
voters voting on the measure is required for passage of the Special
Parcel Tax.
