Impartial Analysis from City Attorney
Since 1973, the City of Campbell has imposed a Transient Occupancy Tax on persons staying in hotels, inns or similar lodging facilities for a period of thirty days or less. This tax is expressly authorized by State Law, and is commonly known as a Hotel Tax.
The tax rate is a percentage of the amount charged for occupying the lodging facilities. The current tax rate is ten percent, which was enacted by an ordinance of the City Council in 1995, and ratified by the voters in 1998. A yes vote on Measure N would increase the tax rate charged for occupying hotels and other lodging facilities to twelve percent starting on January 1, 2011; and there would be independent annual financial audits.
According to the City's Finance Department, the approval of Measure N would raise approximately $250,000 in additional revenue for the City. This revenue would be deposited in the City's general fund, and would be available for use by the City for any of its general expenses, including such things as 911 emergency responses, firefighting efforts, police patrols, crime prevention, city streets and pothole repair, after-school programs for children/teens and nutrition programs for seniors.
