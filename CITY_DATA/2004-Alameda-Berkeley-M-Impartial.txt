Impartial Analysis from Berkeley’s City Attorney
Ambulance-based paramedic service, which is also referred to as Advanced Life Support (ALS), is provided by three Fire Department ambulance transport units. Approximately 40% of the cost of this service is funded by a special tax of $0.02626 per square foot on all improvements to real property in the City of Berkeley, which raised approximately $1,965,000 in FY 2004. This tax, if approved, will increase the paramedic special tax to a rate of $0.041634 to cover the projected FY 2005 deficit in the ALS program of $1 million, and provide an additional $200,000 that can be used to expand paramedic service to all of the City's fire stations. Paramedics with the equipment, skills, and training to provide ALS intervention prior to the arrival of an ambulance would be assigned to each of the City's seven fire engines. At present, this tax may be increased annually by the cost of living in the immediate San Francisco Bay Area. This measure would allow it to be increased by the greater of the increase in the cost of living or per capita personal income growth in California. This measure would also authorize the expenditure of the additional tax proceeds resulting from the rate increase through fiscal year 2008-09.
Financial Implications  The proposed tax rate would limit the annual cost for an average 1,900 square foot home to $79.10 in FY 2005-06. It is estimated that the tax will cost residential taxpayers no more than the following average amounts during FY 2005-06:

Square Feet		Annual Tax
1,200			$ 49.96
1,500			$ 62.45
1,900			$ 79.10
3,000			$ 124.90
10,000			$ 416.34
