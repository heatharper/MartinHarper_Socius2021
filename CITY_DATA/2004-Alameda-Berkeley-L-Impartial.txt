Impartial Analysis from Berkeley’s City Attorney
The City's main library and branch libraries are almost entirely funded by a citywide special tax of $0.132172 per square foot on all improvements to residential real property in the City of Berkeley, and $0.2001 per square foot on all improvements to commercial, industrial and institutional real property. In Fiscal Year 2004, the library tax raised approximately $11,272,200. The tax is indexed to the greater of the cost of living in the immediate San Francisco Bay Area or per capita personal income growth in California. If approved, this measure would increase the tax rates on residential property from $0.132172 to $0.1540 per square foot, and on other property from $0.2001 to $0.2331 per square foot, to pay for existing library costs such as facilities, personnel, books and supplies, as well as expansion of the literacy program. It would also change the annual inflation factor from the greater of the cost of living in the immediate San Francisco Bay Area or per capita personal income growth in California to a maximum of 5%. Finally, if approved this measure would increase the City's authority to expend the proceeds of this tax to equal the amount collected.
Financial Implications  The proposed tax rate would limit the annual cost for an average 1,900 square foot home to $292.60 in FY 2005-06. It is estimated that the tax will cost residential taxpayers no more than the following average amounts during FY 2005-06:

Square Feet		Annual Tax
1,200			$ 184.80
1,500			$ 231.00
1,900			$ 292.60
3,000			$ 462.00
10,000			$ 2,331.00
