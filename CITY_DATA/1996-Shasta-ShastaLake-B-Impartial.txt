IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
MEASURE B

If adopted by a two-thirds vote, this measure would impose a Special Tax for Police
Protection Services to be imposed on each parcel of property located within the City
of Shasta Lake. The revenues received from the special tax will be placed in a special
fund to be used only for operating and maintaining police protection, supplying
equipment for police protection, paying salaries and benefits to police protection
personnel, and for other necessary police protection expense. The special tax would
expire in five (5) years. The special tax would be $10.00 per month per single-family
dwelling unit. Commercial and industrial property would be assessed $10.00 a month
per each 2.7 employees. Unimproved property would be assessed $5.00 per month.
The special tax would be collected in two equal installments at the same time and
in the same manner as the property taxes. The revenues are to be used only Tor
police protection services. The tax rate cannot be increased by the City Council nor
may the tax be extended by the City Council. Unexpended revenue raised by the
special tax must be used for police protection services in the succeeding year and
the tax rate would be lowered the succeeding year or the unused revenue refunded
to the tax payers on a pro rata basis. This measure would also increase the City of
Shasta Lakeâ€™s appropriation limits, for the years in which the ordinance is in effect,
to include the amount of revenues raised by the Special Tax for Police Protection
Services.
