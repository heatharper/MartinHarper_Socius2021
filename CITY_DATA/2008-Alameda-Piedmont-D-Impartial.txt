Impartial Analysis from City Attorney
Measure D is a replacement for the City's current Municipal Services Tax. The new tax is would raise a maximum of $1,500,000 (the same rate as the current tax adjusted for inflation).
Since 1980, the City has relied on the Municipal Services Tax to supplement the funds generated by real property taxes, sales taxes, and other revenues in order to provide the level of municipal services expected by Piedmont residents. Measure D is designed to allow the City to provide police, fire, paramedic and public works services at current levels. Without the passage of Measure D personnel reductions, service cutbacks and decreased maintenance of city parks and streets are possible if there is a downturn in the economy and the City's revenues are decreased.
The City Council has a long-standing practice of levying only the amount of tax needed in any given year and if the economy remains strong, it is likely that the maximum tax will not be levied. In fiscal year 2007-08, the City Council levied no tax.
For the past 27 years the City has relied on a Municipal Services Tax. Passage of Measure D provides insurance that important basic City services will continue to be provided.
