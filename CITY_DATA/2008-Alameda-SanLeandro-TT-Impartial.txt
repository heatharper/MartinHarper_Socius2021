CITY ATTORNEY IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF
MEASURE TT

San Leandro Police Services Parcel Tax

The San Leandro City Council has placed a measure on
the November 4, 2008 ballot asking voters to adopt an
ordinance that would allow the City to impose a special
tax on real property owners to provide funding for police
services and programs within the City and maintain the
current level of police protection at a minimum of 94
sworn officers.

If approved by the voters, this parcel tax would be collected from property owners annually. The amount of the tax
varies depending on a property’s use as follows:

•	Commercial/Industrial $12.00 per thousand

square feet

•	Residential-Single Family $48.00

•	Residential-Multi-Family/ $24.00 per unit
Mobile home

• Unimproved

$3.00 per thousand
square feet

•	Non-profit education/	$10.00 per thousand

Places of worship	square feet

•	Exempt	$0.00

The City Manager may adjust these tax rates annually by
the percentage increase, if any, in the Consumer Price
Index.

The ordinance provides that the City will adopt administrative guidelines to assist in implementing this tax. The
administrative guidelines will address how the taxing category for mixed-use property will be determined, address
procedures to allow lower income senior citizen residential property owners to apply for a tax reduction, and will
address matters related to the interpretation and enforcement of the ordinance.

The ordinance provides a claims procedure for requesting
a tax refund, and imposes penalties for untimely or unpaid
taxes.

This tax is a special tax. If approved by the voters, this
special tax becomes effective on January 1, 2009 and
remains in effect for 4 years. At the expiration of the 4
year period the ordinance automatically terminates, unless
