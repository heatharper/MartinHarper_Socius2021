CITY OF DAVIS
CITY ATTORNEY’S
IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE Q

Measure Q, if approved by a majority of the voters voting on the measure, will re-authorize and extend a 1/2 cent sales tax within the City of Davis. This additional 1/2 cent sales tax was originally authorized by a majority of the Davis voters in June 2004 for a six year period, ending December 31,2010. The re-authorization would continue the existing 1/2 cent sales tax at the same rate for six years, ending on December 31,2016. The cent sales tax would continue to be a general tax, meaning that the revenue raised from the tax would go into the City’s general fund and could be used for any legal governmental purpose.

California Revenue and Taxation Code sections 7285.9
and 7290 authorize the City to levy a transactions and use
tax (sales tax) in quarter cent (1/4 cent) increments (generally
up to a maximum of 2%) so long as the tax is approved by
two-third’s of the members of the City Council and by a
majority of the voters voting in an election on that issue.

The current sales tax within the City (including state
and local sales taxes) is at total of 8.75%, including this
City 1/2 cent sales tax and the temporary 1 % state sales tax
in effect through June 30,2011. If Measure Q is approved
by a majority of the voters voting on this measure, the total
sales tax would remain at 8.75 percent. If Measure Q is not approved, effective January 1, 2011, the total sales tax would decrease to 8.25 percent. In either case, the
total sales tax will reduce by 1 % when the temporary 1 %
state sales tax expires, unless the state takes action to
extend this 1 % tax.

The 1/2 cent sales tax re-authorization and extension
set forth in Measure Q would sunset and be repealed
on December 31,2016 and could not be collected after
that time unless two-third’s of the City Council place an
extension or re-authorization of the tax on the ballot and
a majority of the voters voting in an election approve it.
