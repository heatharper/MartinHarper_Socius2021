CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS MEASURE U  


if enacted, Measure U will increase the City of San Juan Bautista’s General Fund Transactions and Use Tax (commonly known as Sales Tax) from the current rate of three-quarters of one percent (0.75%), to one and one-quarter percent (1.25%), to be utilized for general governmental purposes.  If enacted, Measure U will also provide for appointment by the City Council of an advisory-only citizen panel to provide suggestions to the City Council regarding expenditure of 40% of the proceeds of the tax collected at the 1,25% rate. Forty percent of the proceeds is the difference between proceeds at the current rate (0.75%) and proceeds at the proposed rate (1.25%).  To be enacted, Measure U must be approved by a simple majority of those City electors voting on the Measure.  A “yes" vote on Measure U favors increasing the tax and authorizing  the citizen panel as described above.  A “no" vote on Measure U opposes increasing the tax and authorizing the citizen panel as described above.
