CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF PROPOSITION FF

This ballot proposition has been submitted to the voters by action of the City
Council on July 30, 1996. In so doing, the City Council is asking the voters to
approve Ordinance No. 1-96-1, thereby ratifying and re-enacting the provisions
of Ordinance No. 1100 adopted July 27, 1993.

Ordinance 1100 imposed a Utility Users Tax on the consumption of telephone,
electricity, natural gas, and water in an amount of not to exceed 6% on the amount
of such services actually used by each consumer. Such tax is paid by the consumer
as part of the billing sent to the consumer by the providers of such services. Such
tax produces approximately $700,000 per year which is utilized by the City Council
to pay for general municipal services such as police, fire, parks, streets etc., are
a part of the “general fund” of the City, and are not set aside for special purposes.

Although such Utility Tax became effective on July 27,1993, under court decisions
then extant, a December 12, 1995 decision by the California Supreme Court
indicates that such taxes should receive the retroactive approval of the electorate.
The City Council has responded to that decision by unanimously placing the
Utility Tax on the ballot for voter approval at this time.

If this Proposition FF is approved by the voters, the same utility tax as was enacted
in July of 1993 will be validated as of that date, and will continue in effect at not
to exceed 6% until modified, increased, or terminated by vote of the voters on
a future ballot proposition.

If you are in favor of the actions of your City Council in enacting a Utility Tax
on July 27,1993 with a limit of a 6% rate, all as more fully set forth in Ordinance
1100 and Ordinance 1-96-1 (this Proposition), Vote “YES”; if you are not in favor
of the Utility Tax, vote “NO”.
