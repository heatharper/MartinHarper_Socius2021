IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
CITY OF STANTON

The City Attorney has prepared the following title and summary of the chief purpose and points of the proposed measure:

The proposed Measure, if passed by the voters, would do the following:

•	Repeal the existing Utility Users Tax;

•	Repeal the existing Protective Services Tax;

•	Obligate the City Council to dissolve the existing Landscaping and Lighting District, thereby terminating the property assessment;

•	Obligate the City Council to abandon the existing Street Lighting District, thereby terminating the property assessment; and

•	Enact a Public Safety Services Fee to be levied and assessed on each parcel of property in the City of Stanton.

The Fee would be charged on a per parcel basis at the rate of $16.88 per month for each residential unit {single family dwelling, apartment,
second unit, condominium or mobile home site). For each improved commercial or industrial parcel the rate would be $211.00 per month per acre.
For each vacant parcel the fee would be $52.75 per month per acre.

The revenues raised by the Public Safety Services Fee would be placed in a special fund and used only for the purposes of obtaining, furnishing,
operating, and maintaining police service and protection, fire service and protection, emergency medical service, and for paying the salaries and
benefits to police, fire and emergency medical service personnel.

The Measure would provide that the rate of the fee be automatically adjusted each year by the percentage increase or decrease of the Consumer
Price Index.

The Measure would prohibit the City Council from raising the fee above the maximum rate approved by the voters; however, it allows the City
Council to reduce the rate of the fee in any fiscal year.

If the Measure is adopted and then all or any part of it is held to be unconstitutional, and such holding materially affects the legal enforceability
and levy of the Public Safety Services Fee, the Utility Users Tax will automatically be reinstated.

If the Measure is not passed by the voters, the City's Utility Users Tax, Protective Services Tax, Landscaping and Lighting Assessment, and
Street Lighting Assessment would continue to be levied and collected for the benefit of the City of Stanton to the extent permitted by law.
