CITY OF CAMARILLO
CITY ATTORNEYâ€™S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS
OF BALLOT MEASURE "P"

Measure: "Shall Ordinance No. 840 entitled "AN ORDINANCE OF THE
CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF CAMARILLO AMENDING THE
CAMARILLO MUNICIPAL CODE TO IMPOSE A SPECIAL LIBRARY TAX"
be adopted?

Analysis: The City Council of the City of Camarillo has submitted to the
electorate for approval an Ordinance No. 840, which would impose, if
approved by the electorate, a special $25 annual library tax, upon a per
parcel basis, on all properties located within the boundaries of the city. If
approved, the $25 parcel tax could not be increased without voter approval.

The proceeds from the tax, if the electorate approves the same, could be
used only to support the Camarillo Library. Specifically, use of the tax
revenues is limited to the following library purposes:

1.	the Maintenance and Operating Costs of the Library; and/or

2.	for the purpose of providing funds for Major Library Capital
Improvements; and/or

3.	cost Of administrative expenses, directly related to the operation
of the Library.

This is a "special" tax which requires the approval of not less than 2/3rds of
the voters voting on the matter.

If the City were to take over the operation of the Camarillo Library from the
County, the proceeds of the tax could be utilized by the City for the
continued operation of the Camarillo Library.

If adopted the tax would be levied for a period of five (5) years and could
only be renewed for any additional period by another vote of the electorate.
