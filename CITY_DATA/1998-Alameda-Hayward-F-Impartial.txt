

CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE F

Measure F seeks approval for the continued collection of the Supplemental
Building Construction and Improvement Tax (“SBCIT”). The SBCIT, enacted
by the City Council in October 1990, is a general tax imposed upon new construction and certain commercial construction improvements in the City. Most
of the future revenue will be collected from developers, contractors and builders
who seek permits for development projects. Revenue from the SBCIT is used
to fund general governmental services such as police services, fire department
services and public works projects.

Measure F does not impose any new taxes or change existing law. Proposition 218, passed by California voters on November 5, 1996 requires general
taxes, such as the SBCIT to be approved by a majority of the voters if the tax is
to continue beyond November 5, 1998. Without majority approval, authority to
collect the SBCIT will end and the fiscal impact to the City’s general fund will
be a reduction of approximately $1.4 million dollars annually.
