IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE C

INITIATIVE - AUTHORIZES SPECIAL TAX
TO FINANCE MUNICIPAL SERVICES

This initiative Measure proposes to add a new ordinance to the
Ordinance Code of the Town of Atherton that would allow the City Council
to continue to impose a Special Tax on Real Property to finance
Municipal Services, such as police protection, street repair and
maintenance, drainage facility repair and maintenance, building
regulation, and park maintenance where other sources of revenue are not
sufficient because of restraints imposed by Article XIITA of the
California Constitution also known as Proposition 13. The ordinance would
correspondingly increase the appropriations limit under Article XIIIB of
the California Constitution.

City Council must conduct duly noticed public hearing on proposed
tax after adoption of annual budget. Tax may not exceed the total amount
of expenditures necessary to provide adequate levels of municipal
services, as determined by the City Council, after deducting the projected
revenue to be gathered from sources other than the Special Tax.

Tax on individual parcels may not, however, exceed in any year the
amounts set forth in Section 4 of the proposed ordinance.

Tax will be a lien on individual parcels and may be collected by the
Town or the County Tax Collector at the option of the City Council.

Any monies raised by this Special Tax may he used only for said
municipal services. In accordance with Article XIIIB of the California
Constitution, all revenues received in a fiscal year and the fiscal year
following it in excess of the Townâ€™s appropriations limit during that fiscal
year and the fiscal year immediately following it shall be returned by a
revision of tax rates or fee schedules within the next two subsequent fiscal
years.

Authority to levy this tax will commence with the tax year 2000-2001
and will expire with the tax year 2003-2004, and may only be amended or
repealed by a two-thirds vote.
