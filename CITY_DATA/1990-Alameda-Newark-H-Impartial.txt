CITY ATTORNEYâ€™S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE H

Measure H proposes increasing the Transient Occupancy Tax for hotel and motel occupants from its
current rate of 6 1/2% to 7 1/2 %

This tax only affects persons using hotel or motel rooms in the City of Newark. At present, the tax is
6 1/2% of the amount charged for the room and is paid by the visitor as part of the hotel/motel bill. The
owner of the hotel/motel collects the tax and remits it to the City. The City may use the money for
general fund purposes.

The Transient Occupancy Tax has not been increased since 1981.

Adoption of this measure by a majority vote is required by Government Code Section 53720 et. seq.
before the City Council of the City of Newark may adopt the tax increase by adoption of a resolution
of the City of Newark.
