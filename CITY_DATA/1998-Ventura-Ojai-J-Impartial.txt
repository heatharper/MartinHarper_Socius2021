CITY OF OJAI CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS  MEASURE “J"  



This Measure, if adopted, would retroactively approve the City’s existing Transient Occupancy Tax ('TOT') rate of ten percent (10%) from August 1994 to and including the effective date of this Measure. This Measure would not impose a tax on Ojai's residents or businesses. Instead, this Measure would validate the payment of a ten percent (10%) TOT by those visitors who have occupied hotels in the City since August 1994. Specifically, this Measure would retroactively approve Resolution No. 94-35, adopted by the City Council on June 28,1994, which provides for a ten percent (10%) TOT.  The TOT is a genera) tax used to meet the City’s obligations to the community in the provision of current and future vital public services, including police, fire, storm drain and street maintenance, youth and recreation programs, senior services, planning and growth management, and parks and landscape maintenance, among other things.  This Measure, if adopted, would have no impact on the existing TOT. It will provide voter approval of the law as it existed from August 1994 through the effective date of Measure "J".
