IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE L

The City of Gardena currently collects a transient occupancy tax, also known as a
“bed tax” or “hotel tax” from transients (those occupying hotel or motel rooms
within the City of Gardena for 30 days or less). The transient pays the tax to the
hotel and the hotel remits the tax to the City of Gardena. The City of Gardena
deposits transient occupancy tax revenue into its General Fund, which supports a
number of City services, including police and fire protection, street repairs and
youth and senior recreation activities. The transient occupancy tax is currently
charged in the amount of 7% of the cost of the hotel room. This measure
proposes to increase the transient occupancy tax from 7% to 11%. This measure
would also clarify the intent that all transients occupying a hotel or motel room
for 30 days or less will be required to pay the tax for the first 30 days of the stay
unless a lease for a period longer than 30 days is entered at the time of initial
occupancy.

The increase in the transient occupancy tax rate is submitted to the voters of the
City of Gardena to comply with the requirement of Article 13C, sec. 2 of the
California Constitution. That enactment requires approval of the increase of a
transient occupancy tax deposited into the City of Gardena’s General Fund by a
majority of the voters voting in an election on the issue. If approved by a majority
of the voters, the increase will go into effect on January 1,2003.

A “Yes” vote favors increasing the rate of the transient occupancy tax imposed
on transients in the City of Gardena from 7% to 11%.

A “No” vote disfavors increasing the rate of the transient occupancy tax imposed
on transients in the City of Gardena and maintains the transient occupancy tax
rate at 7%.
