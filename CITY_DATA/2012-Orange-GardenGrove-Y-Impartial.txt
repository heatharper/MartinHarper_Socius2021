IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
CITY OF GARDEN GROVE
MEASUREY

The Hotel Visitors Tax is a tax paid by guests that stay in hotels motels or other similar accommodations (collectively hotels”) in the City of Garden
Grove. The Current Hotel Visitors Tax rate, that was approved by Garden Grove voters in 2082, is 13% of the current rental rate. The tax revenues generated
are used for general City of Garden Grove governmental purposes such as police, fire, street maintenance, and: park and recreation services. If approved by
a majority of the voters, this measure will enact an ordinance increasing the tax rate from 13% to 14.5%.

This measure would also clarify existing language in the Garden Grove Municipal Code to (1) ensure that Garden Grove receives the full amount of
the tax due for room rental when hotels offer packages that combine room charges with other activities, such as amusement park tickets or food
services; (2) confirm the application of the tax to time-share projects; (3) confirm the application of the tax to “block reservations" (i.e. reserving a group of
rooms for “as needed” use), usually triads by corporations for intermittent use by corporate employees; and (4) update other existing provisions clarifying the
scope and application of the Hotel Visitors Tax.

Measure Y must be approved by a majority of the votes cast by the
voters on the ballot measure..

A	“yes”	vote	on	Measure	Y	will approve the amendments to the City’s Municipal Code described above.

A “no” vote on Measure Y will disapprove the amendments to the City’s Municipal Code described above.
