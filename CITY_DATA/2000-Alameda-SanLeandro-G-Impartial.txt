CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE G

REAL PROPERTY TRANSFER TAX REPEAL

EXISTING LAW

The City of San Leandro currently collects a real property transfer tax on the
sale or transfer of real property valued in excess of one thousand dollars. The
current tax rate is six tenths of one percent (.6%) of the purchase price of the
real property. All of the money is deposited directly into the City’s General
Fund, where it currently comprises approximately 6% of the City’s General
Fund operating budget. The real property transfer tax raised approximately
$3,000,000 for the City General Fund between July 1999 and July 2000. The
City’s General Fund is projected to receive $3,500,000 from the real property
transfer tax between July 2000 and July 2001. The General Fund is used for
basic City services such as police, fire, maintenance of parks, medians, streets
and public facilities and recreation programs for youth and seniors.

OPERATION OF THE INITIATIVE MEASURE
If approved, this initiative would repeal the real property transfer tax now
collected by the City. The initiative would prohibit the City from imposing a
new real property transfer tax. The initiative would not affect the real property
transfer tax that is currently imposed by the County of Alameda on property
sold or transferred within the City of San Leandro. The initiative may not be
amended in the future unless the amendment is approved by the voters.

EFFECT OF THE INITIATIVE MEASURE
If approved, this initiative will reduce the revenue available to the City for
continued operation of essential and existing City services. The initiative will
not reduce the property tax bill paid by City property owners on an annual basis.
