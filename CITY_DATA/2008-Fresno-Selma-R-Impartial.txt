IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY

On August 4, 2008, the City Council of the City of Selma adopted Resolution
No. 2008-60R calling for a City wide municipal election to be consolidated with the
general election on November 4, 2008, on “Measure R” the “City of Selma Transient
Occupancy Tax Increase Measure.” Current City ordinances establish a transient
occupancy tax on the privilege of occupying a room or rooms in any hotel, inn, tourist
house, home, motel or other lodging where the occupancy is for a period of less than
thirty (30) days. The tax is required to be paid by the transient or occupant of such
lodging to the operator of the hotel, motel, inn or other lodging. The tax rate under
current ordinances is six percent (6%) of the rate charged by the operator. Measure “R”
provides for an increase in the transient occupancy tax from six percent (6%) to ten
percent (10%) of the rate charged to the transient for the privilege of occupying any
room or rooms in any inn, hotel, motel, tourist house or home or lodging within the City
for a period of less than thirty (30) days. The measure and the implementing Ordinance
No. 2008-07 adopted by the Selma City Council will amend that part of existing City
ordinances which impose the tax by increasing the tax rate from six percent (6%) to ten
percent (10%) and changing the name of the existing City ordinance from the
“Transient Room Tax Ordinance” to the “Transient Occupancy Tax Ordinance.”

The City is authorized to impose the transient occupancy tax pursuant to
Revenue and Taxation Code §7280. The transient occupancy tax is a general tax; that
is, one that generates revenues for general governmental purposes. Article VIIIC of the
California Constitution (Proposition 218) requires that the increase in the tax rate be
approved by a majority of the electorate.
