(Elections Code Section 5011)

On April 11/ 1988, the Atwater City Council adopted Ordinance No.

from four percent (4%) to eight percent (8%). According to law
and the provisions of the ordinance, this increase cannot go into
effect until approved by the voters.

If approved, this measure will require operators of hotels,
motels, etc. to collect a tax from transient occupants at a rate
equal to eight percent (8%) of the periodic room rate. The
measure will not result in an increase in taxes to the general
population or property owners of the City. The proceeds from the
taxes will be used for general municipal purposes.
