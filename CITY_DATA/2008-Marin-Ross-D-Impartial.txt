TOWN ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS
OF MEASURE D

The ballot measure presented is whether the Town of Ross
shall levy a municipal services tax for four years from July
1, 2008, to June 30, 2012, in the manner provided in the
ordinance to be voted on and to thereby increase the
Town’s appropriations limit to fund general governmental
services.

The ordinance provides that each year during the budget
adoption process, the Town Council shall determine the
total amount of expenditures necessary to provide adequate
levels of municipal services or capital improvements and to
deduct therefrom the projected revenue to be gathered from
sources other than the proposed municipal services tax.
Once that amount is determined, the Town Council shall,
within the maximum limits set within the ordinance, deter-
mine the total amount to be raised by the proposed tax and
apportion the tax among all improved parcels of real property or utility users within the Town limits.

The ordinance provides for notice and public hearing
before the adoption of the tax; its inapplicability to use of
property legally exempt from tax; allows for additional
exemptions by resolution; sets forth the manner of collection and the increase of the appropriations limit required to
fund the tax.
