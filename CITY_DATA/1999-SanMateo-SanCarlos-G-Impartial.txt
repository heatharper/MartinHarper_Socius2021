IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE G

The initiative proposes a $6.00 per parcel special tax for ten (10) years,
commencing July 1, 2000. After ten (10) years, the tax automatically
terminates.

The funds received are earmarked to be spent only for long term capital
repairs of parks and park facilities. Examples of the repairs are major field
renovation, roof on the Senior Center, replacement of bleachers, and resurfacing tennis courts. Ordinary maintenance is specifically excluded.

The City will match the funds raised by the tax with funds from the
City's General Fund.

The Permit User Fee adopted by the City on January 11, 1999 will be
rescinded if this measure passes.

The initiative requires a two thirds (2/3) majority vote to pass. If adopted,
it can only be amended by another initiative requiring a two thirds (2/3)
majority vote.

Exempt from the tax are parcels owned by church, religious, government and public utilities. Also, owners of residential parcels who are seniors (age 65 and over) can obtain an exemption from the tax.
