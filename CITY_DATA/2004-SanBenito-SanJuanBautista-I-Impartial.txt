IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
MEASURE I

The San Juan Bautista City Council has placed Measure I on the
March 2,2004 ballot asking voters to adopt an ordinance that would
impose a special transaction and use tax of .75% (three-quarters
of one percent) of the retail sales price to pay for police and fire
protection services, and capital infrastructure projects.

Currently, retail sales in San Juan Bautista are taxed at the rate
of 7.25%, Of this tax, 6% goes to the State, 1% goes to the City,
and .25% goes to the County. The 1% sales tax deposited into
the Cityâ€™s general fund where it is available to fund genera!
governmental services.

A recent change in state law allows cities to impose a transaction
and use tax, which is a form of sales tax. Measure I, if passed by
voters, would adopt an ordinance that allows the City to impose a
special transaction and use tax at the rate of .75%. The ordinance
specifies that the proceeds from this transaction and use tax may
only be used for police and fire protection services, and for capital
infrastructure projects. If Measure I is passed by the voters, the total
sales tax rate in San Juan Bautista will be 8%.

A "yes" vote is a vote to adopt the ordinance allowing the City to
impose a special transaction and use tax at the rate of .75%. A "no"
vote is a vote against adopting this ordinance.

Measure I requires a "yes" vote of two-thirds of the voters to pass.
