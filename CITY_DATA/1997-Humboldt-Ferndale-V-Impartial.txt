IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
MEASURE V

This measure would impose an annual assessment on all real
property parcels within the City of Ferndale at the rate of $25.00
per parcel. The funds realized from the proposed assessment
would be used for storm drain maintenance, repairs, and improvements as deemed necessary by the Ferndale City Council. The
proposed ballot measure requires voter approval by a two-thirds
majority. Based upon the number of parcels within the City of Ferndale, anticipated annual revenues would be approximately
$20,000.00.
