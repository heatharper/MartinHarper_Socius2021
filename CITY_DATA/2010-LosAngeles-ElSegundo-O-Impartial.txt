CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE O

The utility users tax (or “UUT”) was first adopted in 1988. It is imposed on
commercial and industrial service users of electricity, water, communication
services, and gas. Measure O proposes adopting an ordinance that would
increase all existing UUT rates by one percent (1%) until June 1, 2013. If
approved by voters, the UUT tax rate would be as follows:

UUT Category	Current Rate	New Rate
Electricity	3%	4%
Gas	3%	4%
Water	3%	4%
Communication Services	2%	3%
Revenues from the UUT	- approximately	$5.3 million

2008-2009 - can only be used for the City’s general governmental purposes.
Publicly available documents estimate that Measure O would annually
provide the city of El Segundo with approximately $1,970,000 of additional
revenue.

The tax cannot be increased in the future without voter approval. And, the
tax increase proposed by Measure O would be automatically rescinded on
June 1, 2013. Thereafter, the UUT would revert back to its current rate.

To be adopted, Measure O must be approved by a simple majority of the voters
in the city of El Segundo.

A “yes” vote on Measure O favors the Measure.

A “no” vote on Measure O opposes the Measure.
