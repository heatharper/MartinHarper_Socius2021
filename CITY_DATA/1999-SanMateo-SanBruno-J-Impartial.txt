IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS J

The California Constitution authorizes an increase in taxes if approved
by the electorate.

A general tax requires a majority vote and is imposed for general
governmental purposes, such as, but not limited to: fire, general administrative, library, parks and recreation, and police services.

The City of San Bruno proposes to add Section 3.16.180 to the
San Bruno Municipal Code to impose an Airport Parking Facility Tax. This tax is imposed on businesses operating facilities with the purpose of providing parking or storage of motor vehicles for persons going to or from the
San Francisco International Airport. Airport parking facilities are typically
utilized by those who reside outside of San Bruno and drive to the airport.
The amount of the tax is 8% of the facility’s gross receipts generated by the
parking or storage of vehicles. Upon a finding of public benefit, the
ordinance allows the City Council to reduce the tax below 8%.

Similar taxes are imposed by neighboring cities surrounding the
San Francisco International Airport. Based upon the 8% rate, the tax is
expected to generate approximately $550,000 annually for the City’s general fund. This revenue will likely increase if additional airport parking
facilities operate in San Bruno.

If the measure is approved, the City of San Bruno Municipal Code will
be amended and the airport parking facility tax will become effective
January 1, 2000.
