IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
MEASURE O

In 2004, City voters approved a temporary % cent sales tax increase which was
originally scheduled to sunset on June 30,2010. In 2008 City voters extended the
sunset date to December 31, 2017. As a result of these two voter approvals the
current sales tax rate (combined state and local sales tax) in Capitola is 8 %
percent.

This ordinance, if adopted by the voters, would increase the sales tax rate by
another % percent from the current rate of 8 % percent to 8 !4 percent. The sales
tax increase proposed by this ballot measure has no sunset date. Accordingly if the
proposed permanent % percent tax increase is approved by the voters, the City’s
sales tax, also known as the City’s retail transactions and use tax, will total 8 !4
percent through December 31,2017 and 8 % percent thereafter.

All City revenue generated by the sales tax is used by the City to pay for general
City operations and programs including public safety and street improvements. As
such, this ballot measure proposes a “general purpose tax” rather than a “special
purpose tax” and requires a simple majority vote for adoption.
