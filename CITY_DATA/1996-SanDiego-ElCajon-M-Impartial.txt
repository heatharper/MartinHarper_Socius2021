CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS

A “yes" vote on this measure will repeal Ordinance No. 4471 adopted May 9, 1995. Repealing
Ordinance No. 4471 will change Chapters 5.04 and 5.08 of the El Cajon Municipal Code by
reducing the annual business license tax $20.00 per business and eliminating a $14.00 per year
tax on individual rental units. In addition, a “yes” vote will exempt rental apartments with fewer than
five (5) units and rented residential homes from paying any business license tax. Most businesses
currently pay $40.00 annually, plus $3.00 per employee, for a business license. The effect of this
measure would be retroactive and become effective July 1, 1996, and may require the City to
refund taxes collected pursuant to Ordinance No. 4471 after that date. The amount of any such
refund is presently unknown. A repeal of Ordinance No. 4471 will result In a decrease in revenues
to the City's general fund by approximately $400,000 for Fiscal Year (FY) 1996-97. This loss in
revenue will increase the projected budget deficit to approximately $1.8 million for FY 1996-97. The
projected $400,000 annual loss would be permanent.

A “no” vote on this measure will leave the current version of the El Cajon Municipal Code
unchanged.
