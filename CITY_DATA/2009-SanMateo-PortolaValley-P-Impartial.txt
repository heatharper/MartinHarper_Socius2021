Impartial Analysis of Measure P

This measure asks whether the people of Portola Valley wish to
continue the reduction of the existing five and one-half percent (5.5%)
Utility User’s Tax levied on telephone, gas, water and electricity charges
to four and one-half percent (4.5%) for a period of four years from July
1, 2010 through June 30, 2014, at which time the tax will revert to five
and one-half percent (5.5%). A “Yes” vote is in favor of continuing the
reduction of the Utility User’s Tax to four and one-half percent (4.5%). A
“No” vote is not in favor of reducing the Utility User’s Tax. In order for
the tax to continue to be reduced to four and one-half percent (4.5%), the
ballot measure must be approved by more than fifty percent (50%) of the
voters voting on the measure.

The proceeds from the Utility User’s Tax are deposited into the
Town’s General Fund and are expended for general governmental purposes,
including, but not limited to, the maintenance of streets, parks, trails and
drainage structures. If the ballot measure does not receive a favorable
majority vote, the five and one-half percent (5.5%) Utility User’s Tax will
continue to be levied and collected at a rate of five and one-half percent
(5.5%).

This ballot measure does not affect the Town’s second Utility User’s
Tax, a two percent (2%) Utility Users Tax on telephone, gas, water and
electricity charges, the proceeds of which are deposited into the Town’s
restricted Open Space Fund.
