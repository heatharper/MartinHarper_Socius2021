IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
MEASURE M

The City Council of the City of Exeter, California, has put before
the voters an ordinance proposing to increase the City’s
Transient Occupancy Tax to eight percent (8%). This is a tax
charged to guests staying in hotels and motels within the City of
Exeter.

The proceeds of this tax will go into the City’s general fund to be
utilized as determined by the City Council to assist in the
financing of parks, public safety, and other general city services.
The current tax rate is four percent (4%) and this increase will
make the Exeter tax rate equal to the lowest rates currently
charged by other cities in Tulare County.
