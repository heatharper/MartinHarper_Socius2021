THE WAY IT IS NOW: San Francisco collects a 1.5% (one-and-
one-half percent) "payroll expense" tax from companies and individuals doing business in the City. "Payroll expense" means
salaries and other payments made to employees, owners and
partners who work in the City. Currently the City does not have a
“gross receipts” tax.

THE PROPOSAL: Proposition K is an ordinance that would create
a temporary four-year "gross receipts" tax on certain companies
and individuals doing business in the City. "Gross receipts" means
the total amount of money a business takes in for certain goods
and services. The gross receipts tax would only apply to money
received for goods and services sold in the City. Certain small
businesses would be exempt from this tax.

•	In 2005, the City would collect 0.1% (one-tenth-of-one per-
cent) of gross receipts from companies and individuals doing
business in the City.

•	The City would reduce this rate for 2006, 2007 and 2008 if
gross receipts tax funds collected in 2005 exceed $30 million.

•	The gross receipts tax will expire on December 31, 2008.

The gross receipts tax funds could be used by the City for any
public purpose.

The gross receipts tax would apply in addition to the payroll
expense tax.

Proposition K would also clarify how the payroll expense tax
applies to certain businesses, including partnerships, limited liability partnerships, and limited liability companies.

A "YES" VOTE MEANS: If you vote "yes," you want to clarify how
the City's existing payroll expense tax applies to certain businesses, and you want to create a temporary four-year 0.1% (one tenth
of one percent) gross receipts tax on companies and individuals
doing business in the City.

A "NO" VOTE MEANS: If you vote "no," you do not want to make
these changes.
