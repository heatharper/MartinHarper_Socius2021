IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASUR. RR

Pursuant to California Constitution Article XIII C, Section 2(d),
(Proposition 218), effective July 1,1997, Measure “RR" proposes to levy
a Special Tax for a six (6) year period commencing fiscal year 1998/99
for certain City park and recreation services according to the following
formula:

Tax Category

Single Family Residential

Multiple Family Residential
Mobile Home Park Residential
Commercial/Industrial
Vacant Residential
Vacant Other

Annual Tax Rate

$31.50

$23.63

$15.75

$126.00 per acre
$15.75

$63.00 per acre

Prior to the passage of Proposition 218, the City of Lake Elsinore
collected funds for park maintenance and other services through rates
charged in the Lighting and Landscape Maintenance District (LLMD)
established in 1988, with fees set annually by the City Council. Pursuant
to Proposition 218, the City may no longer collect that portion of LLMD
tees used to pay for park maintenance services without a vote of the
electorate. In addition, due to significant budget reductions, general
funds available to pay for recreation services have decreased approximately $320,000 in the past 3 years. The Senior Center, currently funded
with Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds allocated to
the City by the federal government, lacks a reliable and stable funding
source insofar as the CDBG funds could be reduced or reallocated.

Proposition 218 authorizes the City to levy a Special Tax to pay for
these park and recreation services if approved by a 2/3rds vote of those
persons voting at the election. It is estimated that the levied Special Tax
will generate approximately $1,050,000 of which: (i) approximately
$650,000 represents revenues lost as a consequence of Proposition 218;
(ii) approximately $320,000 will replace lost general funds for recreation
services, and (iii) approximately $80,000 represents new funds available
for operation and maintenance of the Senior Center.

The City services to be funded and percentage of tax proceeds to
be allocated to each service are as follows:

Services	Percent of Tax Proceeds

(Dollar Amount)

Parks	62%

Recreation	30%

Senior Center	8%

Since this is a Special Tax, in order to be effective, it must be
approved by a 2/3rds vote of those electors voting in this election.
Likewise, the percentage allocations of tax proceeds may be used only
as authorized by the electorate and for no other purpose. After six (6)
years, the Special Tax proposed by Measure “RR” cannot be levied
without approval of 2/3rds of the electors voting in a future election.
