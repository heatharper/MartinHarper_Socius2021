Impartial Analysis of Measure L	


If approved by a majority of the voters, Measure L will authorize an additional 1/4 cent tax on sales to be levied within the City of San Mateo. This 1/4 cent tax on sales would be a “general tax,” meaning that the revenue raised from the tax would go into the City’s general fund and may be used for any municipal governmental purpose. Municipal governmental purposes may include police and fire protection, library facilities, public works, street maintenance and repair, programs for seniors, parks and recreation services, and other governmental functions and services. The measure does not bind the City to use the proceeds of the tax for any particular services, facilities, or programs.

The 1/4 cent tax on sales would be levied in addition to the current
sales tax and would be collected at the same time and in the same manner
as the existing sales tax. Currently, the sales taxes in San Mateo (including
state and local taxes) are nine and one quarter (9.25%) percent of the
purchase amount. If this measure is approved, the sales taxes in San Mateo
will be nine and one half (9.5%) percent of the purchase amount.

As proposed the authorization to collect this tax on sales will expire in
8 years. After that time, the tax on sales authorized by this measure will no
longer be imposed.

State law authorizes the City of San Mateo to levy this 1/4 cent tax
on sales (technically referred to as a transactions and use tax) following
approval by two-thirds of the City Council and a majority of the voters
voting in an election on that issue. The San Mateo City Council unanimously
approved this tax on July 13, 2009.

If approved by a majority of the voters at the November 3, 2009
election, the 1/4 cent tax on sales would become operative on April 1,
2010.

A YES vote approves the measure.

A NO vote rejects the measure.
