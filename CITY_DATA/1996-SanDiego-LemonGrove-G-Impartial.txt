CITY ATTORNEYâ€™S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS

This is an advisory measure only. The County of San Diego has created a County wide
Assessment District to fund a Regional Communications System. No assessments will be imposed
on real property within the City of Lemon Grove unless the City Council requests that the Board
levy such assessments. The amount of the proposed assessment on any given parcel of real
property would vary depending upon the use of that parcel.
