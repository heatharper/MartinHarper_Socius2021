CITY OF GRIDLEY
IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS
OF MEASURE E

The County of Butte currently imposes an occupancy tax on lodgings of less than thirty (30) days duration. The CITY OF GRIDLEY
has enacted a Uniform Transient Occupancy Tax, (subject to
voter approval by a majority vote of those voting on this measure)
similar to that currently in effect in Butte County, which would impose a tax in the amount of six percent (6%) of the rent charged for
the privilege of occupying a lodging within the City.

Lodgings covered by the tax would be those premises rented for
use by transients for overnight accommodations and would include motels, hotels, inns, tourist homes, beds and breakfast,
rooming houses, apartment houses, mobile home parks, recreational vehicle parks, campgrounds or parking areas.

Any person having an occupancy or a lodging for a period of thirty
(30) consecutive calendar days or less is subject to the tax. The
proprietor of the lodging shall collect the occupancy taxes and remit them to the City on a quarterly basis.

The proposed Ordinance also contains provisions concerning
penalties and interest if the tax is not paid as well as provisions relating to remedies for collection of unpaid taxes. If the measure is
approved, it will result in an increase in revenue to the City in the
amount of six percent (6%) of the rent charged to transients for
their temporary occupancy of lodging within the City.
