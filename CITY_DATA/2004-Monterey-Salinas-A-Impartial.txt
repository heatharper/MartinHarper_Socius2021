IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY TEMPORARY TRANSACTIONS AND USE TAX ORDINANCE MEASURE A  



The total current sales tax rate, also referred to as the "transactions and use tax," imposed by the State of California is 7.25%. This ballot measure, if adopted by a majority of the voters, would enact a temporary fifteen-year one-half of one percent (0.50%) increase to the sales tax rate imposed within the City of Salinas. Accordingly, the total sales tax rate would increase to 7.75%. The rate would be reduced by one-quarter of one percent (0.25%) for all such transactions occurring on or after April 1, 2010, thereby fixing the total sales tax rate at 7.50% for the remaining life of the tax. The tax would terminate in its entirety on April 1, 2020. The proposed increased sales tax, like the current sales tax, would be imposed upon the sale of all tangible personal property sold at retail within the jurisdictional limits of the City as well as upon the storage, use or other consumption of tangible personal property purchased from any retailer in the jurisdictional limits of the City.  The revenue generated from the proposed sales tax increase would be deposited in the Cityâ€™s general fund and, accordingly, all monies collected pursuant to this increase to the sales tax rate would be used by the City to pay for the usual and current City general services such as police, fire, park maintenance, street maintenance, and recreational facilities and programs. As such, this ballot measure is a "general purpose tax," rather than a "special purpose tax," and requires a simple majority vote for adoption.
