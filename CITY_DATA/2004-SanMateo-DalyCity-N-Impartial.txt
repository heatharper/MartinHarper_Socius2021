

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE N

The Daly City City Council has placed this matter on the ballot for voter
determination. A majority of the voters approving this measure is required.
Revenues generated from the changes in the Business License Tax will be
general revenues to Daly City. General revenue money pays for a wide
variety of basic City services including public safety, parks, libraries,
building repairs and road maintenance.

This measure increases the annual general Business License Tax by 300 per
$1,000.00 of gross receipts greater than $100,000.00 with an annual
minimum tax of $100.00, increased from the existing annual minimum of
$50.00.

For residential rental property businesses the proposed Business License
Tax would be 500 per $100.00 of gross receipts, but not less than $100.00
per year per residential rental property business. Residential units or
spaces occupied by the residential building owner for living purposes are
exempt for the Business License Tax.

Charitable and non-profit organizations are exempt from paying a Business
License Tax.

A majority vote of the City’s voters voting in this election is required to
approve this measure. The tax could not be increased in the future except by
another vote of the City’s voters. This measure, if approved, would not be
effective until January 1, 2005 nor be collected earlier than October 1, 2005.

A “yes” vote on Measure N is a vote in favor of approving the proposed
increase in Business License Taxes for Daly City.

A “no” vote on Measure N is a vote against the proposed increase and the
Business License Tax rates will remain as established.
