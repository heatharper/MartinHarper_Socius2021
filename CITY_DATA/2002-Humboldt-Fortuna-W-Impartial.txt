CITY ATTORNEYâ€™S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE
TO AMEND THE TRANSIENT OCCUPANCY TAX

MEASURE W

This measure asks the voters of the City of Fortuna whether the
City of Fortuna should be allowed to amend the Transient Occupancy
Tax (TOT) from the existing rate of 8% to 10%, and allocate 1% of
the annual TOT revenue to the Chamber of Commerce for the
promotion of tourism.

The TOT is calculated on the room or space rent charged by
motels and RV parks. The tax is generally paid by tourists and
other visitors to the motels and RV parks, and not by the residents
of Fortuna.

If adopted, the actual tax rate as set forth in Fortuna Municipal
Code Section 3.12.030, or its successor, would be amended from
8% to 10% and 1% of total annual TOT revenue would go to the
Chamber of Commerce to promote tourism. The other 1% of the
increase would go to the general fund to provide essential government
services.

The TOT revenue for fiscal year 2000-2001 was $221,521. Based
on that amount, the increase in the TOT would generate an additional
$44,000 per year, with $22,000 allocated to the Chamber of
Commerce and $22,000 allocated to the general fund. The actual
amount is expected to be higher due to the additional revenues from
the newest motel which was recently completed.

Because a portion of this tax is being allocated for a specific
purpose (1% for the Chamber of Commerce for the promotion of
tourism), this is a special tax, and requires a 2/3 vote to pass.
