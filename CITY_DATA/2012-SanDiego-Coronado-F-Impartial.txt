IMPARTIAL CITY ATTORNEY ANALYSIS OF BALLOT MEASURE F

Measure F proposes to increase the City of Coronado's current Transient Occupancy Tax ("TOT")
from 8% to 10%. The TOT, also known as a hotel tax, is imposed only on hotel visitors who visit
the City of Coronado for 25 consecutive days or less. The City's Municipal Code defines "hotel"
as any structure, or portion of any structure, which is occupied, or intended, or designed for
occupancy by transients for dwelling, lodging, or sleeping purposes. The tax is collected by hotel
operators based on the rent paid by a person to occupy a hotel and transmitted to the City.

The City's existing TOT rate of 8% has been in effect since 1995. If passed, Measure F would
amend the City's Municipal Code to increase the TOT rate by two percent (2%) and establish the
total rate of 10%. Measure F does not change the City's Municipal Code in any other manner.

Measure F is a general tax and would be deposited in the City's general fund to be used for any
general governmental purpose of the City. Services commonly supported from the City's general
fund include police, fire, beach lifeguards, parks, library, capital improvements, public facilities
maintenance, non-enterprise public works (such as beach grooming), and general government
functions that support them (financial, personnel, administration, insurance, etc). Measure F must
be approved by a majority of the votes cast by the qualified voters of the City to take effect.

A "yes" vote for Measure F will increase the existing TOT from 8% to 10%.

A "no" vote against Measure F will leave in place the existing TOT rate of 8%.
