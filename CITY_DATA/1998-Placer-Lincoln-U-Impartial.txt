CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF 
MEASURE "U"

Approval of this measure by a majority of the voters voting in
this election will adopt Ordinance 658B enacting a Motel
Occupancy Tax in the City of Lincoln.

This tax would be imposed on persons who rent or pay for
rooms or space in motels, hotels, inns, or other similar establishments for a period of thirty (30) consecutive calendar days
or less.

The tax would be in the amount of ten percent of the rent or
consideration charged by the operator of the motel. The
operator would collect the tax at the same time payment or
rent is collected for the room or establishment. Operators who
fail to remit the tax to the City will be charged with certain
monetary penalties and subject to criminal prosecution.

The revenue collected from this tax will be deposited into the
City’s general fund and may be spent for any municipal purpose.

If adopted, this ordinance may be amended or repealed only
by another measure adopted by the voters.
