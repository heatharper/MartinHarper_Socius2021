CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF PROPOSITION DD

The ballot proposition' submitted to the voters validates and reenacts the city’s
utility user tax.	

The utility user tax is a tax on the use of telephone, electricity, natural gas, water, 
and cable television services in the city. The tax would also be extended to satellite dish television services if subsequently authorized by the Federal Communications
Commission. The tax is paid by the consumer as part of the utility bill.

Proposition DD limits the amount of the tax to 6%. The City Council can reduce
and adjust the rate of the tax from time to time but can never increase the tax
above the 6% cap.

The proposition provides that the tax will expire in ten years or earlier if repealed
by the City Council. Upon expiration, the tax could not be reimposed or extended
without a vote of the electorate.

The utility user tax is a general tax. General taxes are taxes not limited to a specific
purpose and are used for general city functions, such as police, fire and library
services as well as maintenance of streets and parks.

The ballot proposition is proposed in response to a recent California Supreme
Court decision. When the City Council adopted the utility user tax in 1992, courts
had ruled that general taxes could be adopted by the city council without a vote
of the electorate. The California Supreme Court recently overturned those earlier
decisions, holding that general taxes require voter approval.

A “yes” vote on the proposition ratifies the past collection of the utility user tax
and authorizes the continued collection of the tax. A “no” vote will probably
invalidate the tax and might require the City to refund sums previously collected
under the existing utility user tax. The proposition will be adopted if it is approved
by a majority of the voters.
