IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
MEASURE A
CITY OF STANTON

The City Attorney has prepared the following title and summary of the chief
purpose and points of the proposed measure:

Utility user taxes are specifically authorized by existing State law. In 1993,
Ordinance No. 740 was adopted by following the requirements of the law at
that time. Ordinance No. 740 imposed the utility user tax. Later court
decisions require taxes such as those imposed by Ordinance No. 740 to be
approved by the voters. This measure will allow voters to decide whether or
not to have the City continue to collect and impose the tax.

The proposed Measure, if passed by the voters, would do the following:

•	Confirm the enactment of Ordinance No. 740 which imposed the utility
user tax, currently at 5%.

•	Authorize the continued collection and expenditure of utility user taxes
for any general municipal purpose such as fire service, general city
administration, law enforcement, recreation services, street repairs,
youth and senior citizen services, etc.

•	Not allow an increase in the utility user tax rate without a vote of the
people, but would allow for a decrease in the tax rate by the City
Council.

•	Allow the City Council, by Resolution, to continue to establish one or
more classes of persons or utility services who are exempt from the tax.

If the Measure fails, the utility user tax could no longer be collected and the
funds from the tax would be unavailable for City services.
