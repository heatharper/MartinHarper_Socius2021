In 1997 Albany voters approved a ballot measure to continue funding for
Emergency Medical Services (EMS). This funding allowed the Fire Department
to continue to provide a Basic Life Support (BLS) level of service on fire
engines and Advance Life Support level of service on ambulances for emergency medical calls in Albany.

Measure N, if approved by the voters, would provide additional funding to
enable Albany to enhance its level of service on fire engines from Basic Life
Support to paramedic Advanced Life Support.

If this Measure were approved by a 2/3 vote, a special tax of $18.00 per
equivalent residential unit (single family household) would be assessed. The
revenue would be placed in the Emergency Medical Services fund and would
be used to provide paramedic Advanced Life Support service on fire engines to
compliment the existing paramedic Advanced Life Support ambulance services
and would also provide additional funding to purchase future ambulances.
