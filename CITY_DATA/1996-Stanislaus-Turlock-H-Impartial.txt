IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
CITY OF TURLOCK UTILITY USERS’ TAX
MEASURE H

A yes vote on Measure H will impose a tax on the use or receipt
of natural gas, electricity, telephone, and cable television services.
The tax will be 4% of the monthly charges for such utility services
and will be collected by the utility provider. Provisions are included
to exempt qualified low income senior citizens.

The revenue will be placed in the City’s general fund which
supports general City services and public safety activities, including
the adopted community goals for service level improvements for
Police and Fire Services.
