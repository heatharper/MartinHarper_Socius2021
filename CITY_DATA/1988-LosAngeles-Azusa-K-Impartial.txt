CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF PROPOSITION K

Proposition K, if approved, would enact Ordinance No. 2379 which would
increase the business license tax of motion picture theaters.

Currently, Section 5.28.040 of the Azusa Municipal Code imposes upon every
person engaged in the business of conducting, managing or operating a motion
picture theater an annual license tax of Twelve Cents ($.12) per seat.

Ordinance No. 2379, if enacted, would increase the tax to Eleven Dollars and
Sixty-Five Cents ($11.65) per seat or parking space available for spectators at
a motion picture theater or drive-in motion picture theater.

The ordinance would also allow the City Council to amend the ordinance with-
out a vote of the people but only to the extent necessary to implement the procedures for collection of the tax, exempt certain events from the application
of the tax, adjust the rate of the tax, but not to exceed the amount set forth
in the ordinance, and as otherwise permitted by Government Code Sections
53720, et seq.

The above statement is an impartial analysis of Ordinance No. 2379. If yon
desire a copy of the Ordinance, please call the City Clerk’s Office at (818)
334-5125 and a copy will be mailed at no cost to you.
