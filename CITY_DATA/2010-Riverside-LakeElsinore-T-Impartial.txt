IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE “T”

This ballot measure, if adopted by the voters of the City of Lake
Elsinore (“City”), would amend the Lake Elsinore Municipal Code by
raising the transient occupancy tax rate from the current rate of 10
percent to 12 percent. The 12 percent transient occupancy tax would be
imposed on hotel and motel guests as well as campground guests.

The transient occupancy tax is a tax paid by guests who spend 30 or
less consecutive days in a hotel, motel or campground in the City. The
tax is based on the rate for each room or campground space. For
example, a hotel guest currently pays a $10.00 tax per night on a
$100.00 hotel room. If the ballot measure is adopted, the hotel guest
would pay a $12.00 tax per night on a $100.00 hotel room.

Currently, 100 percent of transient occupancy tax revenues,
computed at the rate of 10 percent, are dedicated to the City’s General
Fund. All revenue generated by the tax rate increase would also be
deposited in the City’s General Fund.

Because the proposed transient occupancy tax rate increase would
be imposed for general government purposes, the ballot measure
qualifies as a general tax as defined by Article XIIIC of the California
Constitution. Accordingly, for the ballot measure to be adopted, it must
receive a majority “yes” vote.

A “yes" vote on for the ballot measure will enact an ordinance that
will increase the rate of the City’s transient occupancy tax to 12 percent
and impose that transient occupancy tax on hotels, motels and
campgrounds. A “no”’ vote will maintain the City’s transient occupancy
tax at the existing rate of 10 percent on hotel and motels,
