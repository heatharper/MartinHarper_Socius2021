IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY

If approved by a simple majority of the voters of the City of Sanger, ballot
measure S would approve City of Sanger Ordinance 1046, amending
Sections 66-26 through 66-30 of the Sanger City Code by increasing both the
sales and use tax percentage from 0.9600% to 1.46%.

A sales tax is defined as a tax charged on tangible personal property sold by
retailers within the City limits. A Use tax is imposed on the storage, use or
other consumption of tangible personal property purchased from a retailer
within the City limits. The taxes will be collected and administered by the
State Board of Equalization. The revenue from the sales and use tax will be
deposited in the City’s General Fund. The City’s General Funds are used for
police and fire protection, parks and recreation, general services, street
maintenance and Senior Citizen Services.

The State Board of Equalization will have authority to enforce the Ordinance.
The Ordinance includes penalty provisions for failure to pay the taxes and for
providing the State Board of Equalization false tax returns. Should a retailer
wish to appeal any decision of the State Board of Equalization, that Board’s
appeals procedures shall be followed.
