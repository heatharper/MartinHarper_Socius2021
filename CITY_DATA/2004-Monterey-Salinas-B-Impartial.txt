IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY UTILITY USERS’ TAX MEASURE B  This ballot measure, if adopted by a majority of the voters, would amend Sections 32-48 through 32-52 of the Salinas City Code and would increase the maximum annual Utility Users’ Tax from two thousand dollars ($2,000.00) to four thousand dollars ($4,000.00) over a four-year period. The tax is imposed at the rate of six percent (6%) of the amounts billed for telephone, electricity, gas, water, and cable television services.  For the period commencing January 1, 2005, and ending December 31,2005, the maximum annual Users’ Tax for these utility services would be two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00) and for the period commencing January 1, 2006, and ending December 31, 2008, the maximum annual Users’Tax on these utility services would be increased at the rate of five hundred dollars ($500.00) per year. Effective January 1, 2009, and each year thereafter, the maximum Utility Users’ Tax would be increased at a rate equal to the percent change in the Consumer Price Index.  The Utility Users’Tax currently represents twelve percent (12%) of the City’s General Fund. All of the revenue from the Utility Users’ Tax is used for the usual current expenses of the City, including funding for police, fire, park maintenance, street maintenance, and recreational parks and programs. As such, this ballot measure proposes a "general purpose tax," rather than a "special purpose tax," and requires a simple majority vote for adoption.
