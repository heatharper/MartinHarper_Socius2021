IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
MEASUREG

This measure authorizes the City of Morro Bay to assess and collect a new
special tax. The tax will be billed on the annual property tax bill and will be
collected by the County Tax Collector at the same time and subject to the
same penalties as the property tax. The proceeds from this new special tax
will be used to pay for better and upgraded emergency medical services
within the City of Morro Bay. The taxes will be used for such things as
purchasing medical service equipment, supplies or vehicles, salary incentives
for fire fighting personnel to become Paramedics and additional emergency
medical training.

Each year a public report will be issued listing the uses made of the previous
yearâ€™s tax after which the City Council will determine the exact amount of the
tax to be assessed for the following year. The measure establishes maximum
amounts which the tax cannot exceed. The maximum amount for the first
year is eight dollars ($8.00) for each unit of benefit. The number of units of
benefit for different types of improvement to property is set forth in the
measure but the typical number of units of benefit is 2.5 per dwelling for a
single family residence which would mean the maximum amount of the new
tax for the first year for a property on which one single family residence is
located would be twenty dollars ($20.00). The maximum allowable amount
may be adjusted each year by the City Council in an amount not to exceed the
Consumer Price Index.

The appropriation limit established by the California Constitution Article 13 B
will be increased by the amount of the special tax.
