IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
MEASURE D
Westmorland Utility Tax

California Proposition 62, adopted in 1986, requires that taxes adopted
by city councils after July, 1985 be submitted to the electorate for approval.
In 1988, and again in 1991, California appellate courts declared unconstitutional and invalid Proposition 62's retroactive provisions (City of Westminster) and voter approval requirement for local taxes (City of Woodlake).
The California Supreme Court declined to review both decisions.

In reliance upon these decisions and the Supreme Court’s actions,
the Westmorland City Council adopted a Utility Users' Tax (Ordinance
No. 92-04) and did not submit the tax to The city's electorate. The
tax raises revenues to maintain general government services including
police, fire, emergency, administrative, library, parks and recreation.
Four years later, the California Supreme Court changed its position and
declared constitutional Proposition 62's voter approval requirement for
local taxes. (Guardino). The ruling became final on December 14,1995.
The decision brings into question Westmorland’s Utility Users' Tax.

In response, the Westmorland City Council has placed the Utility
Users’ Tax (Ordinance No. 92-04) on the ballot for voter approval of
its continuance after December 1, 1996. The measure would continue
the 5% tax upon the following services: electrical; gas; cable television;
and telephone. The tax rate cannot be increased without the prior
approval of the voters.

A majority vote in favor of this measure will mean that the Utility
Users' Tax will continue after December 1, 1996. A majority vote
against will mean that the tax will have to be repealed.
