Title: Violence Prevention and Public Safety Act of 2004. A Proposed Ordinance Creating A Parcel Tax And a Parking Surcharge on Parking in Commercial Parking Lots In Order To Fund Violence, Crime and Fire Prevention Programs
â€¨Summary: This ordinance raises revenue to fund violence, crime and fire prevention programs in the City of Oakland. The revenue will come from a new parcel tax along with a surcharge on those who park in commercial parking lots. The permitted uses of the revenue are community and neighborhood policing (hiring and maintaining an additional 63 police officers above the currently budgeted 739 officers), violence prevention services with an emphasis on youth, and fire services. The revenue allocated to the violence prevention services will be not less than 40% of the total proceeds allocated for community and neighborhood policing plus violence prevention services. $4 million of the tax proceeds will be allocated to fire services. The parcel tax will be $88.00 for a single family residential parcel, $60.12 for each unit in a multi-family residential parcel. For non-residential parcels, the parcel tax varies depending on the frontage, area and use of the property. See the formula at Part 3, Section 2 (c). The surcharge for those who park in commercial parking lots will be 8 1/2%.
