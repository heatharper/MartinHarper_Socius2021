Summary Prepared by Oaklandâ€™s City Attorney
In 1992, the City of Oakland adopted a 7.5% telephone Utility User's Tax ("UUT"). The tax requires telephone providers to collect the tax from telephone users. The current UUT applies to calls that originate or terminate in Oakland. Wireless telephone service providers have claimed that it is difficult to determine whether a cellular call originates or terminates in Oakland.
In 2002 the Federal Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing Act of 2000 ("the Act") became effective. The Act allows cities to apply the UUT to all cellular calls if the customer's "primary place of use" is within Oakland. The primary place of use is the customer's billing address.
Adoption of the Act's standard would make it easier for cell phone providers to comply with the City's UUT requirements; it also would be easier for the City to monitor compliance with the requirements of the UUT. If adopted by the voters, this measure would not change the existing UUT rate of 7.5%.
