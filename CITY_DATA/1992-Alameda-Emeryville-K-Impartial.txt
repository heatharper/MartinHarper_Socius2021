In 1983 the voters of Alameda County created the Emergency Medical Services District. The County assesses a flat rate
county-wide, and each City Council has the power to increase the rate by approving supplemental assessments to support
the work of the District. Emergency Medical Services (EMS) assessments are shown on yearly property tax bills.

In April, the Emeryville City Council passed Resolution 92-65 imposing a supplemental assessment of $12.00 per
benefited unit for the 1992-1993 tax year. Each residential dwelling is assessed as one benefited unit; commercial/industrial uses are assessed in accordance with size and usage. The City Council also requested that the endorsement
of this supplemental assessment for subsequent years be placed before the voters in the November election.

This ballot measure will not affect the Council’s action in April. The County has already included next year’s
supplemental assessment on the property tax rolls for 1992-1993. This measure does affect whether this $1.OO per month
charge will be levied in subsequent years.

A YES vote will endorse the City Council’s decision to support enhanced Emergency Medical Services (EMS) and
approve a permanent supplemental assessment of $1.00 per month.

A NO vote is a vote against enhanced Emergency Medical Services and will result in the removal of the $1.00/month
supplemental assessment from the property tax bill for 1993-1994.
