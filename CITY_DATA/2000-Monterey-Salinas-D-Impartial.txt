IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
CITY OF SALINAS MEASURE D

Current funding for first responder paramedic and enhanced
emergency medical and related services in the City of Salinas is
through a $5.00 per benefit unit benefit assessment under County
Service Area 74 Zone A. A $12.00 per benefit unit assessment
for emergency medical services was approved by voters countywide
in 1988 and the enactment allowed a local supplemental assessment
of $5.00 per benefit unit. The local supplemental assessment raises
approximately $180,000 annually for paramedic services in Salinas.
After January 1, 2001 Proposition 218 prohibits the funding of those
services through a benefit assessment.

Proposition 218 does allow a special tax to fund first responder
paramedic and enhanced emergency medical services, so long as
the tax is approved by a two-thirds majority vote. The proposed special
tax is to replace the existing $5.00 per benefit unit assessment with
a special tax in the same amount to provide first responder paramedic
and enhanced emergency medical services. If the proposed special
tax is not enacted then the city will lose approximately $180,000
annually and will need to find an alternate funding source or discontinue
the paramedic program.
