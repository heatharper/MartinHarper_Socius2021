CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF
SPECIAL TAX MEASURE B

Following an advertised public hearing on February 20. 2007. the
City Council adopted Resolution No. 06-2007 establishing the City of
Clayton Community Facilities District 2007-1 (Citywide Landscape
Maintenance), (herein "CFD"), the boundaries of which encompass the
entire City of Clayton. The purpose of the CFD is to pay for the costs of
maintaining public roadway landscaping, open space and trails, and for
operating and maintaining the Clayton Fountain. The public services
proposed to be provided by the CFD are itemized in Exhibit "A" to the
Resolution.

in order to pay for these costs and related expenses a special
tax is proposed to be levied annually in the following amounts;

A.	Residential Parcels;	$196.77 per parcel.

B.	Non-residential Parcels;	$196.77 per acre or

fraction thereof.

Further details regarding the above tax rates are set forth in Exhibit “B" to
Resolution 06-2007.

Each special tax rate may be increased annually by the City
Council in an amount not to exceed the most recent full annual
adjustment (April to April of the Consumer Price Index-All Urban
Consumers (CPI). San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose. California area,
base period 1982-84 equals 100). The determination (o apply any CPI
adjustment is not automatic and must be made by the City Council at a
regular public meeting thereof accompanied by a prior recommendation
of the citizens' Trails and Landscaping Committee. The annual increase
may not exceed 3% over the previous year's rate and the possibility of
any rate increase can not be considered until Fiscal Year 2008-2009.

The special tax will be levied annually for a period of 10 years
commencing with Fiscal Year 2007-2008 to and including Fiscal Year
2016-2017, and then will expire.

The new CFD replaces Clayton Community Facilities District
1997-1 which levied an annual special fax for citywide landscape
maintenance purposes the past 10 fiscal years and which tax
automatically ends on June 30, 2007. No further special tax can be
levied by CFD 1:997-1.

Resolution No.07-2007 was adopted by the City Council on
February 20, 2007 proposing an annual appropriations limit of
S850.550.00 (first year budget). The Resolution also called for a special
election to be held on June 5, 2007 for voters to determine whether the
special tax shall be levied, and if the appropriations limit for the District
(first year budget) shall be as stated above.

Passage of the special tax requires a favorable vote of two-thirds
of the votes cast on the measure.
