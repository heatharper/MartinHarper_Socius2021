CITY ATTORNEY IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS

The City currently imposes a 6% Hotel/Motel Tax on persons occupying hotels and motels in
the City of Santee. This tax is primarily paid by visitors to Santee staying at its hotels and motels.
This tax is also referred to as a Transient Occupancy Tax. The City Council desires the ability to
increase the Hotel/Motel Tax from a rate of 6% up to a rate of 15% if the City identifies a need for
additional revenues. Revenues raised from the Hotel/Motel Tax are placed In the City's general
fund and used for projects to benefit the citizens and residents of Santee. The current City Council
has indicated that it intends to use the revenues received from the increase in the Hotel/Motel Tax
for the construction and maintenance of the Town Center Community Park.

Proposition 218 adopted by the California voters in November 1996 requires that all general
taxes be approved by a majority of the voters at a regularly scheduled general election, if a majority
of the voters vote to increase Santee's Hotel/Motel Tax at the regular municipal election held on
November 7. 2000, the City Council will have the ability under Section 3.16.030 of the Santee
Municipal Code, to set the Hotel/Motel Tax at any level between 6% and 15%.
