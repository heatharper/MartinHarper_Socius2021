Measure SG submits an ordinance providing for updated language regarding
technology, compliance with federal law and an increased rate for the existing
utility user’s tax to the voters for their approval in compliance with
Proposition 218, the Right to Vote on Taxes Act.

Measure SG would increase the current 6% rate to 8%. This is a maximum rate
that cannot be increased without voter approval.

Measure SG would maintain existing exemptions for low-income residents.

Measure SG would replace outdated definitions with definitions that address
new technologies and treat all telephone customers equally, whether they use
traditional landline telephones, cell phones or some future mode of
communication services.

The San Gabriel utility user’s tax is a general tax, and revenues collected are used
to pay for the cost of general city operations, including police protection, fire and
paramedic services, park maintenance, and public street paving and repair.

Measure SG requires approval of a majority of the voters. A “Yes” vote for
Measure SG will adopt the changes described above. A “No” vote against
Measure SG will leave in place the City’s existing utility tax without the changes
described above.
