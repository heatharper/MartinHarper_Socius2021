Advisory Vote Only
CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE B

This advisory measure seeks public input regarding whether
the City Council of the City of Pacifica should increase the current utility users’ tax on Pacific Gas & Electric services. The
current utility users’ tax on Pacific Gas & Electric services is 6.5%.
This advisory measure proposes increasing the tax from 6.5% to
9.5%. This advisory measure also provides that the 3% additional
increase would automatically terminate on November 30, 1996,
unless another advisory measure extending or increasing the 3%
increase is approved by a majority of the voters at an election to
be held in November of 1996. If an advisory measure extending or
increasing the 3% increase is not approved by a majority of the
voters at an election to be held in November of 1996, the amount
of the utility users’ tax on Pacific Gas & Electric services would
revert back to 6.5%.

Approval of this measure by a majority of the voters would
indicate the voters’ desire to increase the utility users’ tax on
Pacific Gas & Electric services from 6.5% to 9.5%. Failure to
achieve majority approval of this measure would indicate the
voters’ desire not to increase the utility users’ tax.

In that this is an advisory measure, the approval of this measure by a majority of the voters would not increase the utility
users’ tax on Pacific Gas & Electric services. In order to increase
the utility users’ tax, the City Council of the City of Pacifica
would have to amend the City of Pacifica Municipal Code relating
to the utility users’ tax.
