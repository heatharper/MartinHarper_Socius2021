Title: Cannabis Regulation - An Ordinance that Would Require that the City (1) Establish a System to License, Tax and Regulate Cannabis (Marijuana) Sales As Soon as Possible under California Law; (2) Create a Committee to Oversee the Ordinance's Implementation and Disbursement of Revenue from Licensing and Taxation of Businesses that Sell Cannabis; (3) Adopt Law Enforcement Policies Related to Cannabis; and (4) Advocate for Changes in Laws to Support Implementation and Goals of the Ordinance
Summary: This proposed ordinance would require that the City of Oakland establish a system to license, tax and regulate cannabis for adult use as soon as possible under California law and adopt regulations regarding licensing and taxation of businesses that sell cannabis. The proposed ordinance makes investigation, citation, and arrest for private adult cannabis offenses Oakland's lowest law enforcement priority.
The proposed ordinance would require that the City create an eleven (11) member committee to oversee the implementation of the ordinance. The Committee's responsibilities include (1) ensuring timely implementation of the ordinance's provisions and (2) overseeing disbursement of revenues generated from licensing, regulation and taxation of licensed cannabis businesses to ensure that revenues are spent on City services such as schools, libraries and youth programs.
The ordinance also requires that the City advocate for changes in state and other laws that would allow taxation and regulation of cannabis and end prosecution, arrest, investigation and imprisonment for adult, private cannabis offenses.
