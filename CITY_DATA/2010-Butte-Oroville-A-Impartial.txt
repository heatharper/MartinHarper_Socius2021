CITY OF OROVILLE
CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE A

Since 1969, the City of Oroville has imposed a telephone tax,
which is paid by telephone customers on their telephone bills.
The City’s tax ordinance, like many similar tax ordinances
throughout the state, was written before the introduction of new
communications technologies, such as cellular phones and
broadband service over private networks, including voice-over-
internet. The tax ordinance was also written before several
changes occurred to federal law, namely, the Mobile
Telecommunications Sourcing Act of 2000 and the recent change
in the IRS interpretation of the federal excise tax on long distance
service.

Measure A would enact Ordinance 1760, which updates the
existing telephone users’ tax with a modern telecommunications
users’ tax, and reduces the rate of the tax from 5% to 4.5%. The
tax would be imposed on charges for the use of communication
services, including both telecommunication and video services
(defined to include “the transmission, conveyance, or routing of
voice, data, audio, video, or any other information or signals to a
point, or between or among points, whatever the technology
used”) and ancillary telecommunications and video services
(defined as “services that are associated with or incidental to the
provision, use or enjoyment of telecommunications and video
services”). The modernized definitions would apply to all
intrastate, interstate and international communications regardless
of the technology used to provide such services (e.g., internet
protocol or VoIP), and would also apply to all video services
regardless of the technology used to provide such services (e.g.,
IP-TV).

The measure expands and clarifies the City’s collection
procedures and the process for appealing tax calculations

The communications users’ tax would be a general tax, with its
proceeds deposited into the City’s general fund. Such funds are
available to the City for all of its programs.
