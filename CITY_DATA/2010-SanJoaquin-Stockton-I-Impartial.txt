IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE I
Prepared by Stockton City Attorney

The Stockton City Council has placed Measure I on the
November 2, 2010, general municipal election ballot asking
voters to adopt an ordinance that would amend Stockton's
Business Tax Ordinance, as codified in Title 5 of the Stockton
Municipal Code, to add Chapters 5.98 and 5.99.

The new Chapter 5.98 would establish a new business license
tax category of “Medical Cannabis Dispensaries” at a tax rate
of $25.00 for each $1,000.00 of gross receipts from the
businesses’ activity in Stockton. The amendment will tax gross
receipts from such businesses that sell, cultivate, or distribute
cannabis in accordance with Health and Safety Code sections
11362.5,11362.7-11362.83 or as these laws may be amended
from time to time.

in addition, this measure would add a new Chapter 5.99 to
create a new business license tax category of “Marijuana
Businesses” at a tax rate of $100.00 for each $1,000.00 of
gross receipts from the businesses’ activity in Stockton. This
amendment will tax gross receipts from such businesses that
sell, cultivate, or distribute marijuana for any non-medical
business, personal or recreational purpose, or activity should
Proposition 19, also known as “The Regulate, Control and Tax
Cannabis Act of 2010,” or another similar measure, be enacted
into state or federal law that would allow for or permit the use
of marijuana for such purposes.

The proposed business license tax on “Medical Cannabis
Dispensaries” and “Marijuana Businesses” is a general tax
because the City can use the tax revenue for any legal
municipal purpose. The California Constitution, Article XIII(C),
Section 2(b) requires that the electorate approve a general tax
by a majority vote. Before the City can establish the new tax
rates for "Medical Cannabis Dispensaries” and “Marijuana
Businesses,” a majority of the electorate must approve the
measure.
