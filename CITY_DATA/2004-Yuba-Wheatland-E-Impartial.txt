SUMMARY AND IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF
PROPOSED CITY OF WHEATLAND
EXCISE TAX ON NEW DEVELOPMENT
MEASURE E

The Wheatland City Council proposes to adopt a tax levied on
new development and building, and collected through the City building
permit process. The City Council has approved the tax measure,
subject to approval by majority of the City voters.

The tax would be levied on the privilege of developing and
constructing new and expanded houses and other buildings and
structures. The tax would be paid only by developers and persons
applying for and receiving a City building permit for (1) any new
house, building or structure, and (2) replacement, reconstruction,
remodeling or repair of an existing house, building or structure if
the work would increase the square footage of the existing structure
by more than twenty percent.

The amount of the tax would be a one-time payment of one
percent of the total valuation of the construction work authorized by
the building permit. The City would coiled the tax at the same time
as the issuance of the building permit. The tax revenue would be
deposited in the City’s general fund to be used for general City
governmental purposes (for example, Police Department, Fire
Department, parks and recreation).

The tax would not be levied on building permits for the following
types of construction: (1) work that does not increase the square
footage of an existing house, building or structure by more than
twenty percent: (2) garages, sheds, carports, gazebos, swimming
pools, patios, decks, and similar accessory structures: and (3)
reconstruction or repair of any building damaged by earthquake,
fire, flood or other natural cause.

A “Yes” vote on the measure would be a vote to approve the

tax.

A “No” vote on the measure would be a vote against the tax.
