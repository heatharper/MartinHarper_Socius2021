IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY

Measure A proposes to raise revenue for the purposes of funding police and fire facilities, furnishings
and equipment, by authorizing a sales tax of three-tenths of a percent (0.30%) within the City of Clovis.
The tax would be paid in addition to current state and local sales taxes and would be collected at the
same time and in the same manner as the existing sales taxes.

California Revenue and Taxation Code ยง 7286.48 authorizes the City Council to levy a transactions and
use (i.e., a "sales") tax at a rate not to exceed 0.30% if the tax is approved by a two-thirds vote of the
qualified voters of the City voting in an election on that issue. If approved by the voters, the sales tax
increase would become effective after adoption of an ordinance implementing the sales tax increase but
no sooner than April 1, 2000.

The sales tax increase will remain in effect until sufficient revenue has been collected to pay off bonds
which the City will issue for purposes of constructing a new public safety facility building and a new fire
station. In adopting the sales tax ordinance, the City Council may approve a sales tax increase of less
than three-tenths of a percent (0.30%), but in no event will the increase exceed three-tenths of a percent.
The exact amount of the sales tax will be determined based upon the available financing.
