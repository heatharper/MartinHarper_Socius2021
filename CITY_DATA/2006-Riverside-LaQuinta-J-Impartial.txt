IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE J

The purpose of Measure "J" Is to obtain voter approval of (i) the
Transient Occupancy Tax (TOT) rates contained in the first sentence of
La Quinta Municipal Code Section 3.24.030 as enacted by the La Quinta
City Council in 1992 pursuant to Ordinance 211 and (ii) the definition of
hotel added to Municipal Code Section 3.24.020(1) by Ordinance
211,

The proposed measure does not alter any provisions of the TOT
Ordinance Chapter 3.24 of the Municipal Code).

TOT is imposed on persons occupying hotels and group hotels
within La Quinta for up to 30 consecutive days. The tax is calculated as a
percentage of rent charged by hotel operators. In accordance with
Ordinance 211, the City currently charges an 11% TOT for group hotels
and charges a 10% tax rate for all other hotels. Group hotels are defined
as hotels that have (i) 125 or more rooms, (ii) group meeting space for 50
or more, and (iii) on-site sales that solicit or serve group meetings.
Ordinance 211 did not amend or add other provisions to Municipal Code
Sections 3.24.020,3.24.030 or Municipal Code Chapter 3.24.

In 1986, California voters enacted Proposition 62. Proposition 62
required local governments to obtain voter approval for imposing or
increasing any general tax. Many legal experts opined that this
requirement violated the California Constitution. In 1991, the California
Court of Appeal decided City of Woodlake v. Logan, which concluded
Proposition 62's voter approval requirement was unconstitutional.

TOT has long been a major source of revenue to the City. The City
Council enacted Ordinance 211 in 1992 to do two things. First.
Ordinance 211 amended the first sentence of Municipal Code Section

3.24.030	to increase the rate of TOT to 11% from 10% for group hotels
and to maintain the established TOT at 10% for ail other hotels. Second,
Ordinance 211 amended Section 3.24.020 to add Subsection I, which is
a definition for "group hotels." Ordinance 211 was approved without
seeking voter approval.

Later, in Santa Clara County Local Transportation Authority v.
Guardino, the California Supreme Court overruled Woodlake, and
concluded that Proposition 62’s voter approval requirement was not
unconstitutional. Since then, a number of cases have decided issues
relating to whether taxes enacted before the Guardino decision were
subject to challenge.

The proposed measure, if passed, would validate, re-enact and
authorize the continued collection of TOT at the rates established by
Ordinance 21 Ts amendment to the first sentence of Municipal Code
Section 3.24.030, If passed, this measure would also validate and
re-enact the definition of “group hotel" in Municipal Code Section
3,24.020. as added by Section 2 of Ordinance 211. The proposed
measure does not effect any other provisions of the TOT Ordinance.
