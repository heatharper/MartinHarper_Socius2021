IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY

Measure C asks the voters whether the City of Fowler should collect a Utility User's Tax upon customers
of electricity, gas, and telephone service within the City of Fowler. The tax would be as follows:

•	Five percent (5%) upon residential customers of electricity and gas based upon monthly charges for
the electricity and gas service.

•Three percent (3%) upon commercial, industrial, and agricultural customers of electricity and gas
based upon monthly charges for the electricity and gas service.

•	Five percent (5%) upon all customers of telephones based upon the monthly base service rate for the
local telephone service. The telephone tax will not be imposed upon other services provided by the
service provider, such as long distance and wireless services.

Measure C must be approved by a majority of the voters. If approved, the tax will be effective January
1, 2000 and will automatically terminate in three years on January 1, 2003. The City Council may elect
to terminate the tax sooner.

The tax will be implemented through Ordinance 99-6 approved by the City Council on July 20,1999. The
tax will be collected by the service provider. For telephone service, if the monthly base service rate drops
below the minimum rate currently charged by the City’s primary supplier of telephone communication
services, GTE, the monthly base service rate upon which the tax is calculated will be the monthly base
service rate currently being charged by GTE.

The Utility User’s Tax is a general tax to be used for general governmental purposes of the City of Fowler.
The proceeds of the tax will be placed in the City's general fund and be used for the current expenses of
the City as determined by the City Council in making budgetary decisions. The City would not be legally
bound in any way to use the tax monies for any special purpose or for any particular program or service.
