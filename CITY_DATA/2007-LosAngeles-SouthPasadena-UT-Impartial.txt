As most recently approved by the voters in March 2007, the City of South
Pasadena currently charges a 5% Utility Users Tax on the amount customers
within the City pay for water, telephone, electricity, gas and cable television
services. That tax is collected by each utility as part of the regular utility bill. The Cityâ€™s authority to collect the tax will expire March 3, 2015.

If Measure UT is approved by a simple majority of the voters voting on the
measure, then the amount of the Utility Users Tax would be increased by 3%
from 5% to 8% for the temporary period from February 1, 2008 to March 5, 2013
at which time the utility users tax would return to 5% until it expires on March 3,
2015. The City estimates that the increase would generate approximately
$7,769,500 of additional revenue for the City during the temporary period.

Measure UT is a general tax and can be expended for any general municipal
purpose. However, an advisory measure on the same ballot, Measure AV,
requests the voters to express their preference whether not less than 65% of the
revenue generated by the 3% increase should be used for infrastructure
improvements, such as repair, replacement and improvement of water lines,
reservoirs, sewer facilities, streets, sidewalks, parks, public buildings and other
such infrastructure facilities and not more than 35% of the revenue generated by
the 3% increase should be used for employee salaries to attract and retain
sufficient numbers and quality of employees to efficiently and safely operate city
facilities and provide city services.
