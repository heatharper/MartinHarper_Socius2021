IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE L

This measure seeks two-thirds voter approval of a Special Parcel Tax. The tax
will impose an annual rate of $98.00 for single family residential property and
varying amounts for other property, including higher rates for commercial
properties, throughout the City of Pico Rivera.

According to law, proceeds from the Special Parcel Tax must be used for the
acquisition, construction, furnishing, maintenance and operations of a new
library facility in the City of Pico Rivera. It is expected that the new library will
be operated by Los Angeles County. This new library is expected to replace the
two existing libraries in the City of Pico Rivera.

If passed, this Special Parcel Tax would be adjusted annually using the Los
Angeles County Consumer Price Index. An exemption to the tax would be
available for bona fide non-profit organizations, including churches.

It is expected that the Special Parcel Tax will be in place for 30 years. In total, the
tax will raise approximately $15.2 million dollars for Pico Rivera’s new library
facility. It is expected that the new library facility will nearly triple in size, feature
new computers with Internet access and offer an increased number of new
books, periodicals and research materials.

A “yes” vote on this measure would approve a Special Parcel Tax to be levied on
residential and commercial properties for the acquisition, construction,
furnishing, maintenance and operations of a new library facility in the City of
Pico Rivera.

A “no” vote on this measure may result in a reduction in the hours of operations
or closure of the existing libraries in the City of Pico Rivera.
