IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS MEASURE “Z"
(Construction Impact Tax)

This measure proposes to abolish the current building and plan
check fees and to levy a new construction impact tax on future building
permit and plan check services, based upon the square footage of the
proposed structure. It also eliminates building permit and plan check fees
for miscellaneous permits for patio covers, decks, and block walls and
reduces the residential swimming pool fee to $200.

Presently, building permit and plan check fees are determined
pursuant to a formula generally based upon the application of a building
valuation table and are intended to reflect the actual cost of providing the
service, pursuant to Government Code Section 66014. If revenue
received exceeds the actual cost in a given year, the excess must be
applied to reduce future fees. The basis upon which that reasonable cost
is determined has been disputed and is presently the subject of litigation.
In order to resolve future building permit and plan check fee disputes, this
measure would levy a tax instead of annually attempting to calculate an
appropriate fee. To the extent that the City received any revenues in
excess of the cost of building and plan check services, since the date of
the City’s incorporation which must be applied to reduce future fees, said
excess revenues are specifically included as a part of the tax levied
pursuant to this measure.

This tax would be applied only to future new construction. In order to
be effective, it must be approved by two-thirds (2/3rd’s) majority of the
voters voting in the election and may only be amended or repealed by the
same process.
