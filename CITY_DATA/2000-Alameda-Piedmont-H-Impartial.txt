CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE H

Based on a Cease and Desist Order of the California Regional Water
Quality Control Board, Piedmont and other East Bay cities are required to
make substantial improvements in their sewer systems in order to reduce overflows of untreated wastewater, particularly during winter storms. In practical
terms this means that Piedmont must spend approximately $16,000,000
beyond what has already been spent to upgrade and replace the City’s current
deficient sewer system.

It is clear that the current sewer service charge can barely cover the costs
of current sewer repairs and maintenance. Because of this the City has looked
at various alternatives to finance the major expense, including issuing municipal. After extensive review of various alternatives, the Municipal Tax
Review Committee has recommended a new Sewer Tax as the most cost effective method for the taxpayers. The Tax would cover not only current repairs, but
also the substantial capital expenses in rebuilding much of the City’s current
sewer system.

This new Sewer Tax would increase the average household sewer service
charge approximately $20 per month, but could potentially be reduced a meaningful amount when the capital expenditures for the sewer work required to
comply with the Cease and Desist Order have been completed.

If the City does not complete the required sewer work by the deadline
established pursuant to the Cease and Desist Order, the City could potentially
become subject to large penalties, which could substantially increase the total
cost to the City.
