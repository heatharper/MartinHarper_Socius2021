CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE R

Measure R asks the voters to approve an ordinance that provides for an
additional '/’-cent tax on each dollar of taxable sales of goods in the City of South
El Monte, and on the taxable storage, use or consumption in the City of goods
purchased from a retailer. This is commonly known as a "sales tax,” and is
technically referred to as a “transactions and use tax.” The tax revenues would be
deposited into the City’s general fund and could be used for general municipal
governmental purposes, including police services, pothole and street repairs,
youth gang and drug prevention, after school programs, senior services, storm
drain maintenance, graffiti removal, parks, recreation and other general City
services. The measure would not obligate the City to use the revenues of the
proposed sales tax for any particular services, facilities or programs.

The 1/2-cent sales tax would be in addition to the current sales tax, and would be
collected in the same manner as the existing sales tax. Presently, the combined
State and local sales tax rate in South El Monte totals 9 % cents per dollar. This
measure would have the effect of increasing the total sales tax rate to 10 lA cents
per dollar in South El Monte.

The proposed sales tax would be subject to an annual independent financial
audit that reviews whether the tax is collected, managed and expended in
accordance with law.

The City Council unanimously voted to place this sales tax measure on the ballot.
If approved by a majority of the voters, the sales tax would go into effect April 1,

2011.	A full copy of the text of the sales tax ordinance is printed in these ballot
materials.

A “YES” vote on Measure R will enact the sales tax ordinance to increase by
1/2 cent the sales tax rate in South El Monte. A “NO” vote on Measure R will
result in the sales tax ordinance not being adopted.
