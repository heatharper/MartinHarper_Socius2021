A Measure To Enact A Community Center Facility Tax
In The City of Lincoln

Approval of this measure by two-thirds of the voters voting in this
election will enact a Community Center Facility Tax in the City of Lincoln.

This tax would be imposed on each dwelling unit in the City of
Lincoln. For purposes of this tax, a “dwelling unit" is considered to mean
a unit providing complete, independent living facilities for one or more
persons.

The amount of the tax per dwelling unit would be $59 per year
starting in the year 1998 thru 2007, $63 per year from 2008 thru 2012,
$42 per year from 2013 thru 2017, and $41 per year from 2018 thru 2022
at which time the tax would end.

The revenues from this tax can only be used to assist the Lincoln
Redevelopment Agency in purchasing the Community Center Facility
located at 2010 First Street, Lincoln.

This tax is considered to be a special tax pursuant to Proposition 62
and, therefore, requires two-thirds approval of the voters voting in order
to be enacted. If approved, this tax may be amended or repealed only
by another measure adopted by the voters.

The tax would be collected by Placer County in the same manner
and subject to the same penalty as property taxes.
