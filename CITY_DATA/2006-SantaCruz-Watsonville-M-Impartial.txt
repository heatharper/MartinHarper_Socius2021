IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
MEASURE M

Subparagraph (1) of subdivision (b) of Section 1122 of the Watsonville City Charter, adopted by the voters in 1960, authorized an additional real estate tax in
Watsonville to be collected with other real estate taxes. The purpose of this additional real estate tax was to pay all annual City obligations to the State Employeesâ€™
Retirement System, or other system for the retirement of City employees.

This tax has been collected annually since 1950. The rate in 2004 was 13.4 cents
per hundred dollars of assessed value.

This Measure, if approved by the voters, would amend the City Charter by adding
new language to Section 1122 prohibiting the City from collecting this retirement
tax at a rate exceeding 7.7 cents per hundred dollars of assessed value. This
would reduce and cap the retirement tax paid by all owners of Watsonville real
estate.

This Measure would become valid and effective only if the voters also approve proposed Measure L which would authorize a citywide % cent sales tax. The City
would use the sales tax increase to partially offset this reduction in the retirement
tax.
