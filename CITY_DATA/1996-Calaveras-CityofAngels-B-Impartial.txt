IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
CITY OF ANGELS
MEASURE B

Government Code Section 50078 authorizes any local agency
which provides fire suppression services, by ordinance or by resolution, to determine and levy an assessment for fire suppression
services. The assessment may be made for the purpose of obtaining, furnishing, operating and maintaining fire suppression
equipment or apparatus, whether or not fire suppression services
are actually used by or upon a parcel, improvement, or property.

Any such ordinance or resolution must establish uniform schedules and rates based upon the type of use of property and the
risk classification of the structures or other improvements on, or
the use thereof, the property.

The City of Angels proposes to levy an assessment of approximately $350,000 over a seven (7) year period for the purpose of
obtaining fire suppression equipment and apparatus in accordance with the procedures set forth in Government Code Section
50078, and following.

A YES vote on this measure will authorize the City to adopt an
ordinance or resolution which would levy assessments on property
within the City in accordance with the written report currently on
file with the Clerk of the City of Angels and would allow the City
to purchase fire suppression equipment and related apparatus
also described in the written report on file.

A NO vote would result in an abandonment of the proposed
assessment.
