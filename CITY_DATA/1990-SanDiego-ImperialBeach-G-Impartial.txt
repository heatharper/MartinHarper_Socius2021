CITY ATTORNEY'S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS

In the City of Imperial Beach a tax is charged for the
privilege of occupying a hotel room for a period of time no more
than 30 consecutive	days.	This is commonly	referred to as a

Transient Occupancy	Tax.	At the present	time the tax	is

equivalent to 8% of the rent charged for the use of hotel rooms.
The purpose of this measure is to increase the tax to 10% of the
rent charged. This tax applies only to "transient" occupancy of
hotels, which means	the tax is charged only	when a person	is

occupying a hotel room for less than 30 consecutive days. "Hotel"
is defined to include hotels, inns, tourist homes, motels, studio
hotels, bachelor hotels, lodging houses, rooming houses, apartment
houses, dormitories,	public	or private clubs,	mobile homes,	or

similar structures designed for occupancy by transients for
lodging on a short term basis. State law requires majority voter
approval to increase this tax for general governmental purposes.

If this measure is defeated, the Transient Occupancy Tax will
remain at 8%. If approved by a majority of the persons voting on
the measure, this increase in tax to 10% shall take effect on June
15, 1990.

A "YES" vote means you are in favor of the increase of the
Transient Occupancy Tax to 10%; a "NO" vote means you are opposed
to such an increase.
