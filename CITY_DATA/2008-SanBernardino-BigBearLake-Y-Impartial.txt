MEASURE Y

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS

Measure Y would increase the City of Big Bear Lake’s transient occupancy tax (TOT), also known
as the hotel tax, from 6 percent to 7 percent as of January 1, 2009, and from 7 percent to 8
percent as of January 1, 2010. The new TOT will be imposed upon the paying guests of private
home rentals, full service hotels, motels, bed and breakfast inns, and rental cabins within the City
of Big Bear Lake. The TOT constitutes a debt owed by these temporary (30 days or less)
occupants to the City of Big Bear Lake, which is extinguished only by payment to the operator of
the lodging facility or to the City.

The City’s TOT is not per se a tax upon local residents. It is a general tax upon paying guests
utilizing private home rentals, full service hotels, motels, bed and breakfast inns, and rental
cabins within the City of Big Bear Lake. As a general tax, all TOT revenue is placed in the City’s
general fund and may be used for any lawful purpose including capital improvement projects
Accompanying Measure Y on the ballot will be an advisory vote on whether the City should use
increased TOT revenue to rebuild and renovate infrastructure and capital improvements, and
whether the City should not use increased TOT revenue for general City operations.

Measure Y recites that the City collects approximately $2.5 million in TOT revenue on an annual
basis. Per the City’s 2008-09 fiscal year budget, gross receipts subject to the TOT are estimated
to be $42.5 million and, as such, Measure Y recites that an overall increase of 2 percent to the
TOT is estimated to result in the collection of approximately an additional $850,000 annually.

A “yes” vote will increase the City TOT by 2 percent, from its current rate of 6 percent to 7
percent as of January 1,2009, and from 7 percent to 8 percent as of January 1, 2010.

A “no” vote will limit the City TOT to its current rate of 6 percent.
