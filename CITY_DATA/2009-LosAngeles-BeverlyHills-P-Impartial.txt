The City’s other business license tax rates would remain unchanged.

The City’s Chief Financial Officer estimates that the proposed business license tax revision will generate an additional
5.2 million dollars to 7.2 million dollars in revenue annually to the City of Beverly Hills.

All revenue generated by the City’s business license taxes is retained by the City and deposited in the City’s general
fund. The general fund is the primary funding source for the City’s operations and services such as police services,
fire services, paramedic services, and recreation services. The general fund is also the primary funding source for
maintenance of City facilities and infrastructure (other than utilities) including, parks, streets and sidewalks, and the
City’s library.

Measure P also updates definitions and makes other administrative changes to the City’s business license tax
ordinance.

A “yes” vote approves the revisions to the business license tax ordinance. A “no” vote rejects the revisions to the
business license tax ordinance. Business license taxes may not be increased unless approved by the City’s voters.
