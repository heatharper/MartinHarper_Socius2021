Impartial Analysis of Measure

This amendment to section 3.28.030 of the Weed Municipal Code
would increase from 6% to 8% the "Transient Occupancy Tax". That
tax is added to the charges for hotel and motel rooms, inns, R-V
Parks, and other short-term commercial accommodations in the
city, collected by the owners of such businesses, and all of it
is paid to the city.

If the measure passes, the 6% would continue to go into the
general fund of the city, to be spent for police, fire, roads,
public utilities, and other city expenses, but the additional 2%
could be used by the city only for promotion, community events,
economic enhancement, and community beautification.

Currently, the city receives some $88,000 from the tax. It is
expected that the increase will result in an about $29,000 in additional revenues to the city for the specified purposes.

The City of Yreka has already increased their Transient Occupancy
Tax by the same amount as requested here, and the City of Mt.
Shasta will have a similar measure on its ballot concurrently
with this one.

Because the increase in the tax is to be for a special purpose,
as opposed to mere general revenue, a 2/3 affirmative vote is
required.
