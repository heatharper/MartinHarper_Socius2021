IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE O

PREPARED BY THE CITY ATTORNEY

Effect of Measure on Existing Law

Existing law authorizes cities to impose Landscaping and Lighting Act assessments to
fund installation and maintenance of landscaping, public lighting facilities, and park and
recreational improvements. No approval by the property owners to be assessed or by the
voters is. required.

Proposition 218, a state-wide constitutional initiative on the November 5, 1996 ballot,
would require property owner approval before assessments could be imposed by the City
Council. Assessments existing on or before November 5 and approved by a majority of the
voters voting on the measure will not be affected by Proposition 218, if it passes. Adoption
of Measure O will exempt the Park Maintenance assessment from Proposition 218’s
requirements so long as the Park Maintenance assessment does not increase over its current
level.

Operation of Measure

Beginning in 1989, the City Council annually has imposed a Landscaping and Lighting Act
assessment. Proceeds of the assessment are used to maintain and rehabilitate City parks
and other public landscaped areas and for energy and maintenance costs of street lights
throughout the City.

Beginning with 1996-1997, the Landscaping and Lighting Act assessment is divided into
three separate assessments: Parks Facilities and Related Operations and Maintenance (also
referred, to as the “Park Maintenance assessment”); Street Related Operations and
Maintenance; and Indebtedness for Parks Capital Improvements. The Park
Maintenance assessment raises approximately $1.8 million per year for park maintenance,
park improvements, and graffiti abatement. This measure presents for voter approval the
Park Maintenance assessment, which is $10.89 for single family residences, $7.41 per unit
for multifamily residences, $19.10 for non-residential parcels of 0-25,000 square feet, $95.50
for non-residential parcels of 25,001-100,000 square feet, $198.65 for            non-residential
parcels of 100,001 or more square feet, and $5.46 for churches. The 1996-1997 assessment
is the same as that imposed in 1995-1996.

If Measure O is approved by voters, the City Council will still have to conduct a public
hearing and vote each year to extend the Park Maintenance assessment. If Measure O is
not approved by the voters, the 1996-1997 Park Maintenance assessment will remain in
place, and the City Council will decide whether to impose a Park Maintenance assessment
in subsequent years. The failure of Measure O will not, in itself, prevent the City Council from
extending the assessment.

Fiscal Impact

If Measure O is approved, the Park Maintenance assessment will continue to raise
approximately $1.8 million per year for park maintenance, park improvements and graffiti
abatement.
