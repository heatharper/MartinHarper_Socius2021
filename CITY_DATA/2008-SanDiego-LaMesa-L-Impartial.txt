	CITY	ATTORNEY IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS

Ballot Proposition "L" would raise revenue for general purposes for the City of La Mesa by
authorizing a three-quarter percent transaction and use tax (commonly referred to as a "sales
tax") within the City of La Mesa. The three-quarters of one percent tax would be paid in addition
to current sales taxes and would be collected at the same time and in the same manner as existing sales taxes.

California Revenue and Taxation Code Section 7285.9 authorizes the City Council to levy a transaction and use tax at such a rate, provided the tax is approved by a majority of the voters voting in an election on that issue. If approved by a majority of the voters, the tax would go into effect April 1, 2009 (the "Operative Date").

Proposition L provides that the three-quarters of one percent sales tax is to be used to "maintain
essential City services." Because the tax would be a "general tax," the tax revenue would go into
the City's general fund and could be used for any legal municipal purpose. The City would not be
legally bound to use this tax revenue for any special purpose or for any specifically identified
special services, facilities or programs. Under ^existing law, food purchased as groceries and prescription medications are exempt from California "sales tax‚Äù and therefore those items would
not be taxed under Proposition L.

The authority to levy the tax imposed by Proposition "L" would expire 20 years from the Operative
Date, unless the City Council prior to that date determines that the levy and collection of the tax is no longer necessary, in which case the City Council has the authority to reduce the rate of tax or
terminate the imposition of the tax.
