Summary Prepared by City Attorney
Currently, all Cannabis Businesses in Oakland are taxed at the rate of $18 for each $1,000 of gross receipts. This measure creates new business tax categories that distinguish between "Medical Cannabis Businesses" and "Non-Medical Cannabis Businesses." Under the proposed amendments, the business tax rate for "Medical Cannabis Businesses" will increase from $18 to $50 for each $1,000 of gross receipts, and the business tax rate for "Non-Medical Cannabis Businesses" will increase from $18 to $100 for each $1,000 of gross receipts. The City of Oakland may use the revenue from the tax for any legal municipal purpose, including but not limited to maintenance of vital services and facilities. The tax must be approved by a majority of Oakland voters who cast ballots.
