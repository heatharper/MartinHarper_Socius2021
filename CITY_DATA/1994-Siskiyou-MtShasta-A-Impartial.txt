IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OP MEASURE A
BY CITY ATTORNEY
CITY OF MT SHASTA

This measure, which has been approved by the Mt. Shasta City Council,
subject to voter approval, would impose a tax, in an amount , not to
exceed $8.00 per year for unimproved parcels, $24.00 per year for
improved parcels, and $36.00 per year for commercial parcels, for the
limited purpose of funding the purchase and continuing maintenance of
fire protection equipment, including fire trucks and other vehicles. The
revenues will be used in conjunction with those derived from a similar tax
levied within the Mt. Shasta Fire Protection District, which has jurisdiction
outside the City only, to purchase equipment, etc., for the protection of
both City and County properties.

The tax, if approved, will be effective on July 1, 1994, or as soon
thereafter as permitted under law, and will be collected along with county
property taxes and be subject to the same provisions for enforcement.
The City Council reserves the ability to reduce the tax for certain parcels
which, because of topography, size, or other factors, should not be liable
for the full amount.

The City Council is required to review the tax annually, after a public
hearing, to determine whether it is still needed, in whole or part.

The measure requires approval by two-thirds (2/3) of those voting.
