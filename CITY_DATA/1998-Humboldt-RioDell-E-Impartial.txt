IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
MEASURE E

Measure E asks the voters whether the City of Rio Dell should
collect a utility users tax of 7% on residential customers and 2%
on non-residential customers. The tax would be continued until July
1, 2003, and will be again up for voter approval in the general
election of November 2002. Utility service affected by the tax
includes (1) telephone communication services billed to an account
located within the City’s boundaries; (2) electrical energy services
supplied by an electric corporation or non-utility supplier and used
within the City’s boundaries; (3) gas services supplied by a
corporation or non-utility supplier which is transported either
through pipes or by mobile transport and used within the City’s
boundaries; (4) cable television services used within the City’s
boundaries; and (5) water delivered through city mains or pipes.

The City Council may, by ordinance or resolution, exempt classes
of persons or utilities. The tax would be computed on the basis of
monthly usage and service charges, and would be collected by the
service provider.

The utility users tax is a general tax and all revenue generated
by the tax would go to the City’s general fund to provide essential
governmental services including, but not limited to, public works,
street maintenance, police, parks and recreation and other
essential government services provided by the City. It is estimated
that the tax will generate approximately $135,000.00 per year. This
would equate to 30% of the City’s general fund.

The tax proposed in Measure E is identical to the utility users
tax adopted by the Council in 1995. Voter approval of this Measure
would re-enact the utility users tax, which expired on July 1, 1998,
through July 2003. This measure must be approved by a majority
of the voters.
