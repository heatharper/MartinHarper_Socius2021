TOWN ATTORNEY’S
IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE A

California Election Code Section 9280 requires the
Town Attorney to prepare an analysis of local ballot
measures, showing the effect of the measure on existing
law and the operation of the measure.

Measure A, if approved by 2/3rds of those voting, would
change existing law by adding an additional 1/20 to the
present sales tax. By law, the funds raised by the proposed
increase could only be used to repair and improve the
"backbone" roads specified in the ballot measure and for no
other purpose. The proposed tax would "sunset” or end after
12 years and could not be continued without another vote of
the people.

The operation of the measure, if approved, will be to
provide the additional sales tax revenues to the Town of
Truckee for the specified purposes. Those funds, however,
cannot legally be used to repair and improve roads within
the Town, other than those specified in the ballot. How other
road repairs and improvements are to be paid for, will
require action of the Town Council and/or the voters at a
future date. If the measure is not approved no additional
funding will be made available for road repair and
improvement purposes.
