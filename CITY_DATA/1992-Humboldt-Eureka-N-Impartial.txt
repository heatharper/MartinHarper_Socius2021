CITY ATTORNEYâ€™S ANALYSIS OF
MEASURE N

This proposal, if adopted by a two-thirds vote of the voters voting on the measure, would impose a
special tax on the parcels of property in our City based upon the zoning classification use of or size of
the property. Said tax would be for the specific purpose of funding police protection services. The
proceeds therefrom would be placed in a special fund and the use of the monies would be restricted
to police protection services only. The tax will continue until repealed or modified by the voters, or until
ten (10) years from adoption of this ordinance whichever occurs first. The City Council will be unable
to increase the taxes charged above the maximum set by this measure, but will be authorized to reduce
or suspend the taxes if they find and determine they are unnecessary.

The expenditure limitations imposed by Article XII IB of the California Constitution will be increased in
the amount collected from the tax so that the additional funds may be used for their restricted purposes.
