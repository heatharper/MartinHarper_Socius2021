Proposition 218, approved by the voters in 1996, requires that all new local taxes be submitted
to the voters before they become effective. Approval by a majority of the City’s voters is currently
required before the City Council can levy a new general tax, or increase an existing general tax. A
general tax is a tax that is utilized for general governmental purposes, unlike a special tax, which is
a tax earmarked for a specific purpose. Proposition 218 requires a two-thirds vote to approve a
new or increased special tax, such as a school bond measure or a sales tax earmarked for
transportation projects,

This Proposition would add section 76.2 to the Charter of the City of San Diego to require a two-thirds vote of the City’s voters prior to the Council levying a new general tax or increasing an
existing general tax. Some of the types of taxes which would be subject to this requirement if
Proposition E is approved include sales taxes, development taxes, payroll taxes, business license
taxes and transient occupancy taxes.

Proposition E will take effect if passed by a majority of the City’s voters, unless Proposition F,
which also appears on this ballot, is passed by a majority of the City’s voters. If Proposition F is
passed by a majority of the City’s voters, Proposition E will not take effect unless passed by two-thirds of the City’s voters.
