

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE C3

This proposition seeks voter approval for the imposition
of a special property tax, limited to residential property. If
approved by the voters, the tax revenues would be used
exclusively to pay for stand-by costs of providing emergency
room services at the Biggs-Gridley Memorial Hospital, a critical
access hospital. The proposed tax, in the amount of $70.00 per
residential equivalent unit would expire after ten (10) years.

The Gridley City Council has placed this measure on
the ballot due to concerns that absent supplemental funding, the
hospital might be forced to close and that such closure would
constitute a detriment to the health, welfare and safety of the
citizenry. A two-thirds vote of the qualified electors is required to
impose the special taxes.
