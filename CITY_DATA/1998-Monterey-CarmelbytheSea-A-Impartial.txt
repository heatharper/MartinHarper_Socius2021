CITY OF CARMEL-BY-THE-SEA
MEASURE A

The Carmel City Council passed and adopted Ordinance No. 96-
12 in November, 1996, revising the Business License tax and supporting regulations. The overall impact of this action is to increase
Business License fees, which are general taxes, and because of
that, pursuant to California Constitution, Article , the
matter must be ratified by a majority vote of the people at a general election where City Councilmembers are elected. 

The Ordinance does not create a new tax, but it does increase
the amount of tax paid by some businesses, and does require
that some businesses that were previously exempt now pay this tax.
Although it is labeled a "business license", the Ordinance does not
regulate any business. It is basically a tax. on the privilege of
doing business within Carmel, and is similar to business license
in effect in most California cities.

While there are some exceptions, most businesses would have
to pay an initial application fee of $100 and an annual administrative fee of $50 to cover costs of issuing the Business License,
sin addition, a tax of eighty-eight cents ($.88) per thousand dollars
of gross revenue would also be collected annually. The business
categories of "special event" and "transportation of persons/goods" would pay an annual fee not based on gross revenue
but on the number of events or trips per year. Definitions of what
constitutes "gross revenues" for different businesses is included
in the Ordinance.
