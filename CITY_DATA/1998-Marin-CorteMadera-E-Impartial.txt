IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY TOWN ATTORNEY
MEASUREE

If this measure is approved by the requisite two-thirds vote, an ordinance shall be
adopted in the Town of Corte Madera which imposes a special tax for paramedic and/or
emergency medical services (“EMS”). The amount of the tax may not exceed thirty dollars
($30.00) per year for each living unit and thirty dollars ($30.00) per year per 1,500 square
feet of structure on .each developed parcel in non-residential use.

This is not the first time such a tax has been submitted to and approved by the Town’s
voters. A special EMS tax was approved by the voters on June 7, 1983, and has, since
then, received continuous voter approval extending the tax until June 30,1999. If approved,
this measure will extend the tax for emergency medical services until June 30, 2003.

All of the revenues thus far generated by the EMS tax levied in the Town of Corte
Madera have been paid over to the Ross Valley Paramedic Authority. However, beginning
in the last fiscal year, the tax revenues have been used to establish and operate a new
ambulance service operated by Corte Madera’s Fire Department for Corte Madera residents.
The measure before the voters at the November 3, 1998 election does not require the
taxes authorized therein to be spent for any particular emergency medical service or
emergency medical service provider. However, the taxes, if approved by the electorate

on November 3, 1998, must be used for emergency medical services, including but not
limited to paramedic services, but the manner in which they are used is left to the sound
judgment of the Corte Madera Town Council.
