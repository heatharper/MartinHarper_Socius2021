CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS
OF UTILITY USERS TAX MEASURE F

EXISTING LAW

The City of Pinole currently collects a utility users tax on gas, electricity, and telephone
services provided to both residents and businesses. The tax has been in effect since 1991. The current tax rate is 7%. All of the money collected through the tax is deposited directly into the City’s General Fund, where it comprises approximately 14.3% of the City’s General Fund operating budget. The utility users tax raised approximately $1,006,520 for the City’s General Fund between July 1996 and
July 1997.

The City does not impose a users tax on water, cable television, garbage collection and sewer services. Under existing law, approval by the voters would be required if in the future the City were ever to impose a tax on these services, or if the current 7% rate collected on gas, electricity and telephone services were proposed to be increased.

OPERATION OF MEASURE

If approved, this measure would repeal the users tax now collected by the City from gas, electricity and telephone services. The measure would prohibit the City in the future from imposing any new utility users tax on any of those services in the fixture. The measure would also prevent the City from adopting any fixture utility users tax on water, cable television, garbage collection and sewer
services.

Unless approved by (be voters, the measure may not be amended in the future.

EFFECT OF MEASURE

If approved, the measure would significantly reduce the revenue available to the City for
the confirmed operation of essential and existing City services.
