This measure if approved by a majority of the voters will result in the City Council adopting an ordinance enacting seven and one-half percent (7.5%) utility user
tax. The ordinance provides that the tax may not be increased without prior voter approval, provides for low-income exemption and a cap on the amount paid by
businesses, and has an automatic termination date of June 30, 1997, unless reauthorized by voters prior to its termination. 

The City’s utility user tax presently appearing as Chapters 3.52 and 3.53 of the Morgan Municipal Code imposes a tax upon electric, gas, cable television and telephone services within the City. The rate is 9% for PG&E and Cable TV for residential users. The PG&E rate for commercial users is 7.5%. Telephone services are taxed at 7.5%. Additionally, there is a $5,000.00 cap for commercial users and a low income exemption for residential users. By ordinance No. 1064 New Series adopted on March 4, 1992, this tax has been repealed effective January 1, 1993. 

Figures provided by the City’s Director of Finance show that in fiscal year 1991- 1992 the utility user tax was projected to provide approximately $ 1,910,000.00 in revenues to the City. This figure represents approximately 20% of the City’s General Fund. The utility user tax represents 32% of the tax revenue that goes to the General Fund. The General Fund provides revenues for all City operations, including police and fire services and equipment; general administration; community development and parks; community recreation programs and services; and employees’ salaries. A reduction in revenues will affect some or all of these. 


A yes vote on the ballot measure will result in the continuation of the City’s utility user tax in the manner described above. A no vote will mean that the voters do not approve the adoption of the tax.
