City Charter Section 1101 (c) currently requires that the City Administrator's
fiscal year budget include the probable amount required to be levied and raised
by property taxation. State law currently does not permit such levies to be
imposed by the City Council. This measure amends this section of the City
Charter to conform with state law by deleting the requirement that the City
Administrator's budget for the ensuing fiscal year include the levy of property
taxes.
