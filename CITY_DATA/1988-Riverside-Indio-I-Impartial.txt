IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE I

This proposition provides for an increase in the transient occupancy
tax in the City of Indio from eight percent (8%) to ten percent
(10%). Transient occupancy tax is not a sales, transaction or ad
valorem tax on real property and does not violate the equal protection or
due process clauses of the Constitution. The proposed resolution is not
a tax upon real or personal property, nor is it a tax addressed to the
taxpayers of the City of Indio; rather, it is a tax imposed upon a transient
for the privilege of occupying a room in the City of Indio. In the event
tie City of Indio's current transient occupancy tax rate is increased from
the current eight percent (8%) to ten percent (10%), approximately
$106,000.00 in additional revenue will be generated annually for
general purpose revenue.

A transient occupancy tax is an excise tax imposed for the privilege
of occupying lodgings far less than thirty days, paid by the occupant and
collected and delivered to the City by the operator.

The City Council of the City of Indio has called an elect or for the
purpose of submitting the resolution to the voters within the City of Indio
for adoption.

A "yes" vote on Measure I is a vote to adopt the resolution.

A "no" vote on Measure I is a vote against adopting, the resolution.
