IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
MEASURE B

Background

Under current state law, general law cities, including the City of Clearlake,
may only impose new or higher general taxes if approved by two-thirds of
the City Council and a majority of the voters.

Proposal

This measure establishes a six percent (6%) utility tax to be collected by
the City for general revenue purposes. The proceeds of the tax will be used
in the General Fund of the City. In particular, this measure:

1.	Imposes a six percent (6%) utility users tax on users of telephone,
gas, electricity and television cable services.

2.	Requires each utility provider (telephone, gas, electricity and cable
television) to collect the tax upon the regular charges made for such
utility service provided.

3.	Establishes a procedure whereby the City Council can adopt an exemption or provide a waiver for those utility users who cannot afford to
pay the tax because of age or disability and low income or other
conditions of hardship.

4.	Establishes a procedure by which the City will collect the utility tax
and sets forth an administrative remedy regarding assessments.

5.	Establishes a utility users committee to conduct public hearings regard-
ing the provisions of the measure.

6.	Provides the right to any aggrieved person to appeal.

Because the measure may constitute the imposition of a new or higher
general tax for general fund purposes, it requires the approval of a majority
of the voters.
