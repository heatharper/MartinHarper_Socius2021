IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
INITIATIVE MEASURE TO BE SUBMITTED
DIRECTLY TO THE VOTERS - MEASURE G

The City Attorney has prepared the following title and summary
of the chief purpose and points of the proposed measure:

UTILITY TAX REDUCTION INITIATIVE OF 2002

The City of Greenfield Ordinance Code imposes a tax at the
rate of 6 percent (6%) of the charges for intrastate telephone,
electrical, gas and cable television services upon every person
in the City of Greenfield using intrastate telephone, electric, gas
and cable television service. This initiative will amend the
Greenfield Ordinance Code to reduce the tax on all of the
above services to a rate not to exceed three percent (3%).
There are no other changes to the Greenfield Ordinance Code,
including the exemptions to the tax, the method of collection and
the criteria for determining the charges for each of the utilities.
The tax rate will be reduced by fifty percent (50%) from current
rates. If passed, the reduced rate will go into effect on
January 1, 2003.

The tax, if passed by the voters of the City, shall not exceed
three percent (3%) and cannot be increased without an
election of the voters of City approving the increased
amount. There is no automatic increase in the tax for inflation.
The City Council may, in its sole discretion, decrease the tax in
any fiscal year.
