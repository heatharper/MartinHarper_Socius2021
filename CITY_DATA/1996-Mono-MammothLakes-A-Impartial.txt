OF INITIATIVE MEASURE 96-A

Under existing law, the Town imposes two taxes affected by
Measure 96 A:	The	Utility Tax and the Transient Occupancy Tax.

The Utility Tax is presently imposed at a rate of 3 1/2% and
sunsets June 30, 1997. The Transient Occupancy Tax is presently
imposed at a rate of 10%, but the ordinance which raised the rate
from 9% to 10% sunsets December 31,	1996;	thereafter, the

Transient Occupancy Tax will be imposed at 9%.

In September 1995, the California Supreme Court ruled that
taxes may not be extended without a majority vote of the people.
In order to raise revenue to fund both existing and future Town
programs and services, the Town Council voted to place the issue
of extending both the Utility Tax and the 1% additional Transient
Occupancy Tax rate before the voters.

If Measure 96 A passes, the Utility Tax will be extended at
the reduced rate of 2 1/2% and the Transient Occupancy Tax will
be extended at the present rate of 10%. Both taxes, as extended,
will sunset on June 30, 2011.

If Measure 96 A fails, the existing Utility Tax will sunset
on June 30, 1997, and the Transient Occupancy Tax will revert to
9% on December 31, 1996.

A "Yes" vote is a vote to extend the Utility Tax at the
reduced rate of 2 1/2% and the Transient Occupancy Tax at its
presently imposed rate of 10%. Such extension will provide future
General fund revenues to support both existing and future Town programs and services. 

A "No" vote is a vote not to extend the Utility Tax at the reduced rate of 2 1/2% and not to extend the Transient Occupancy Tax at its presently imposed rate of 10%. If these taxes are not extended, the Town will lose significant revenues when they sunset. If Measure 96-A fails, the practical effect will be a significant decrease in both existing and future Town programs.
