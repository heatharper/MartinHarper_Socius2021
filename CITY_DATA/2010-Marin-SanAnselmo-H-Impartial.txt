TOWN ATTORNEYâ€™S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS
OF MEASURE H

Ross Valley Paramedic Authority Tax

If this measure is approved by a two-thirds vote, the special tax for paramedic services administered by a Joint
Powers Authority will be continued for four more years.
The tax for residential units will be $42.50 per taxable liv-
ing unit in the first year, with the option to be increased
thereafter by $3.00 per year. The tax for non residential
parcels will be $42.50 per 1,500 square feet of structure
for each developed parcel in non-residential use in the first
year, with the option to be increased thereafter by $3.00
per year. The tax will be collected in addition to fees for
transport to the hospital as charged to insurance providers.
The applicable appropriations limit pursuant to Article
XIIIB of the California Constitution will be increased in
an amount equal to the proceeds of the special tax.

If the measure is not approved, the tax will expire on June
30, 2011.
