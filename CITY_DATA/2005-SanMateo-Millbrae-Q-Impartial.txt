IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE Q

If passed by a majority of the voters, this measure would put into effect
Ordinance No. 702 enacted by the City Council on July 26, 2005.
Ordinance No. 702 adds a new Chapter 3.15 to the Millbrae Municipal
Code that establishes a 10% parking tax. This parking tax is a new tax not
currently provided for in existing law.

The purpose and intent of Ordinance No. 702 is to tax airport parking.
Under this Ordinance, a parking tax is imposed on the occupant of a
vehicle for the privilege of parking in an off-street facility operated by a
private party. The parking facility operator will collect the parking tax in
the amount of 10% of the parking fee charged, and remit the tax revenues
to the City on a quarterly basis. The ordinance calls for penalties and
interest assessed on parking facility operators for delinquent tax payments
and requires the parking facility operator to register with and provide
periodic accounting reports to the City. The ordinance also allows for
informal hearings, appeals, and tax refunds when claims of overpayment or
erroneous payment of parking tax revenues are validated. The ordinance
exempts from the parking tax any parking privilege connected with a hotel
stay in the City where the charge for the parking privilege is added to the
room bill. The Ordinance would not apply to parking facilities of
apartments or condominium complexes where tenants or owners of units
may be charged fees to utilize parking spaces.

The City estimates that the parking tax will generate approximately
$50,000 in revenues each year. These revenues go into the Cityâ€™s general
fund, which is used for general governmental purposes such as police, fire,
public works, parks and recreation, library, code enforcement, and capital
improvements.
