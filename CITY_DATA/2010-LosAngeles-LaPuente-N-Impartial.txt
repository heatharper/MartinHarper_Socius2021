If adopted, Measure N (Medical Marijuana Cooperative Tax) would amend Title
V (Business Regulation and Licenses) of La Puente’s Municipal Code to add
Chapters 5.05 to establish a new business license tax for “Medical Marijuana
Cooperatives.”

The tax will apply to businesses that dispense marijuana for medicinal purposes
in accordance with Compassionate Use Act and the Medical Marijuana Program
(Health and Safety Code  11362.5 and 11362.7-11362.83). Medical Marijuana
Cooperatives may not operate for profit or generate a profit. Generally, Medical
Marijuana Cooperatives arc organized as non-profits. Under Article,
Section 26 of the California Constitution, certain non-profit organizations are
exempt from local taxes measured by gross receipts or income. Because of these
exemptions, La Puente’s proposed business license tax includes two taxing
methods:

Method No. 1. Medical Marijuana Cooperatives that qualify for the exemptions
would be taxed at the rate of $100 per square foot of occupied
premises; and

Method No. 2. All other Medical Marijuana Cooperatives would be taxed at
the rate of ten percent (10%) per $1,000 of gross receipts.

The proposed business license tax on Medical Marijuana Cooperatives is a
general tax and the City can use the revenue for any legal municipal purpose.
The revenues derived from this tax will be placed into the City’s general fund for
the usual expenses and for providing essential City services, including, but not
limited to, law enforcement, code enforcement, building inspection, plan checks,
planning, and public works.

The California Constitution, Article(C), Section 2(b) requires that the
electorate approve a general tax by a majority vote before the City can establish
the new tax rates for Medical Marijuana Cooperatives.
