IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY

If approved by a majority of the voters at the March 2, 2004 election, Ballot Measure
“C” will allow a new City Transactions and Use Tax to become effective. The proposed City’s
Transactions and Use Tax was contained in Ordinance No. 685 approved by the Coalinga City
Council on December 1, 2003, however, is not effective until approved by a majority of the voters
at the March 2, 2004 election.

The City Transactions and Use Tax contained in Ballot Measure “C” is a new sales tax
in the amount of seventy-five hundredths of one percent (.75%) and will be charged in addition to
all other sales taxes all currently charged for transactions within the City limits of the City of
Coalinga. It will be charged and collected in much the same way as typical sales taxes are
charged by retailers and others who sell goods and services to the public which are currently
subject to the existing sales tax rates. The new City Transactions and Use Tax will be collected
and then remitted to the City of Coalinga for use by the City of Coalinga for general governmental
purposes. The City Transactions and Use Tax will expire automatically after a period of 10 years,
and may not be renewed or extended without additional voter approval at that time. In
Ordinance No. 685, approving the City’s Transactions and Use Tax, the City Council found and
determined that the proceeds of the City’s Transactions and Use Tax will be essential to maintain
continuing City services.
