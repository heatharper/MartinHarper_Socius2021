IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE W

Real Property Transfer Tax-Amendment to PCC section 50-251

Currently, the City of Pomona imposes a Real Property Transfer Tax (RPTT) in
the amount of $1.10 per $500.00 of property value at the time of sale. The tax is
imposed on “each deed, instrument or writing by which any lands, tenements, or
other realty sold within the city” are “granted, assigned, transferred or otherwise
conveyed to or vested in the purchaser.” (Pomona City Code § 50-251). The tax
is only imposed on transfers of real property within the City limits of Pomona at
the time of sale of such property.

The RPTT was established by the City in 1967, and the current rate of $1.10 has
remained unchanged for the last 21 years (since 1991). Although state law limits
the amount of a real property transfer tax for general law cities, since the City of
Pomona is a charter city, City voters may approve additional real property
transfer taxes beyond the rate set by state law.

If adopted, Measure “W” will amend section 50-251 of the Pomona City Code to
increase the RPTT rate to $2.20 per $500.00 of property value at the time of sale.
If adopted by the voters, it is estimated that the increase will result in an
additional $1,000,000.00 in general funds annually, although the actual results
may vary depending on the health of the economy. All additional revenue
received from the RPTT will be deposited into the City’s general fund, to be
expended on general fund purposes, such as police services, fire protection,
street maintenance, business development and park and recreation services. If
adopted, the RPTT rate of $2.20 would take effect upon the earliest date legally
possible after the City Clerk certifies the votes.

A “Yes” vote on Measure “W” supports the increase in the RPTT rate from
$1.10 to $2.20 per $500.00 of property value at time of sale. A “No” vote on
Measure “W” will maintain the current RPTT rate.
