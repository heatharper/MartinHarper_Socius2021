IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE Q

The City Council of the City of Burlingame placed this measure on the ballot to determine whether to establish a business license tax on operators of commercial parking facilities in the City at a rate of 5% of gross revenues from the parking operation. A commercial parking facility is defined in the
measure to be any parking facility that is privately owned or operated and that
charges a fee or other consideration for parking or storing vehicles.

The proposed measure exempts from the tax:

1)	a parking facility that is not the predominant use of the parcel on
which the facility is located, such as a hotel, condominium, apartment, or
shopping center;

2)	a parking facility that is used by a business to park or store only the
business’ own vehicles, such as a corporation yard; and

3)	a parking facility that is used by a business to park or store only
vehicles that are in the business’ own inventory for purposes of sale, lease,
or resale, such as a car dealer’s storage lot.

The City estimates that the tax would generate approximately $260,000
per year, which would go into the City’s general fund for general government
purposes, including capital improvements, in the City. The tax would be
paid on a quarterly basis based on parking revenues from the quarter.

Because under the proposed measure, the tax revenue would be put into
the City’s general fund for general City government purposes, a majority
vote of the City’s voters voting in this election is required to approve the
measure. Because the tax would be adopted by a vote of the people, the tax
rate could not be increased except by another vote of the people.
