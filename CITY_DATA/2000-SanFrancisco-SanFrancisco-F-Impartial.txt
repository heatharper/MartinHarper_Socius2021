THE WAY IT IS NOW: The City collects a property tax on non-exempt property in San Francisco. The City also collects a
payroll or gross receipts tax on businesses in San Francisco.
Bayview Hunters Point is a neighborhood in the southeast corner of San Francisco. Historically, this neighborhood has
been economically disadvantaged.

THE PROPOSAL: Proposition F would make It City policy to:

•	Waive all home property taxes in Bayview Hunters Point
for five years on property valued under $500,000, where
the owner or the tenants have lived on the property for
three or more years. Tenants would receive half the savings from this waiver;

•	Exempt all small businesses in Bayview Hunters Point from
the City’s payroll tax for five years. Those businesses would
have to pass on half that tax savings to their employees;

•	Appropriate $150 million to create jobs only for residents of
Bayview Hunters Point. The fund would be administered
exclusively by a council elected from the neighborhood;

•	Use City resources to provide Bayview Hunters Point residents with sufficient job training, services, and facilities to
take full benefit of this proposal.

For the purposes of Proposition F, the Bayview Hunters
Point neighborhood is defined by the boundaries of
Supervisorial District No. 10.
