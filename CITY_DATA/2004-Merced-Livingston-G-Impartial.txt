CITY ATTORNEYâ€™S
IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS
OF MEASURE G

This ballot measure if adopted by city voters, would
amend the Livingston Municipal Code by raising the
transient occupancy tax from the current rate of 6% to
9%. The transient occupancy tax is a tax paid by hotel
and motel guests in the City. The tax is on the room
rent paid. For example, a hotel guest would currently
pay $6.00 tax per night on a $100.00 hotel room. If the
ballot measure is adopted, the hotel guest would pay
$9.00 per night on a $100.00 hotel room. The revenue
received by the City from this tax is placed in the general fund.
