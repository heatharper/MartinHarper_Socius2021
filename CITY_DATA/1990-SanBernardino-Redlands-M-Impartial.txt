MEASURE “M”
ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY

This initiative ordinance, if approved by the voters, will allow the City to impose a two and one-half
percent (2-1/2%) tax on utility use. The proceeds of the tax will be distributed equally between the
City's Fire Department and Police Department. Within each department, tax revenues will first be
expended for staffing, wages and employee benefits. Expenditures for wages and benefits will be set
pursuant to a salary survey of certain comparable cities in the area. Any remaining tax proceeds will
be allocated among the following programs: Establishment of an anti-gang/drug task force, expansion of paramedic services, enhancement of the City drug education (D.A.R.E.) program and
purchase of earthquake and disaster preparedness equipment. Tax revenues may not supplant
existing City funds providing the above services, but may only be used to supplement current City
efforts.

The tax will be imposed on telephone, cable television, electric and natural gas services. The tax
will be collected on the utility provider’s utility bills, and will be paid by the utility user. The tax will be
remitted to the utility company, which in turn will make periodic disbursements to the City.

Senior citizens over 65 years of age and certain low income utility users are exempt from payment
of the tax. These users must file yearly exemption claims with the City demonstrating the basis for
exemption.

This initiative ordinance will become effective only upon a "yes" vote of two-thirds of the persons
voting in this election. No amendment may be made to it unless subsequently approved by a two-
thirds vote.
