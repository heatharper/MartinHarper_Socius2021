Background. In 1986 California’s voters approved Proposition 62 to require
voter approval of local general taxes. California courts found Proposition 62
unconstitutional and the City therefore did not seek voter approval of a 1991
ordinance imposing a utility users tax (UUT). The California Supreme Court has
overturned those earlier decisions and upheld Proposition 62. The City Council
now proposes this measure to allow the voters to validate the 1991 UUT
ordinance.

With limited exceptions, every person who uses electric, gas, telephone, or
cable television service in the City pays a UUT of 1% of utility charges for these
services. The UUT is collected via utility bills. The UUT accounts for 2.8% of
the City’s ongoing General Fund revenues. The City uses UUT proceeds to
provide police and fire protection, recreation, street rehabilitation and other
community services funded through the City’s General Fund.

The Measure. The measure would validate and readopt the UUT ordinance and
validate taxes previously collected under that ordinance. The Measure does not
increase the rate of the UUT or make any changes to the existing UUT. The
City Council is authorized to repeal or reduce the UUT or to amend the
ordinance in other ways that do not increase taxes. However, any future
increase in the UUT would require voter approval.
