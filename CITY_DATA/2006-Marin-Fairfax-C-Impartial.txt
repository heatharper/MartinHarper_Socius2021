TOWN ATTORNEYâ€™S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS
OF MEASURE C

If this measure is approved by a two-thirds vote, the special tax for paramedic services administered by a Joint
Powers Authority originally authorized by the voters on
June 7, 1983 and reconfirmed by the voters on November
6, 1998 will be continued with a tax of $39 increasing by
$3.00 per year not to exceed $48 for each living unit, and
in the amount of $39 increasing by $3.00 per year per

1,500	square feet of structure of each developed parcel in
non-residential use. By approval of this Measure the
appropriations limit established in the Town of Fairfax
pursuant to Article XIHB of the California Constitution
will be increased in an amount equal to the proceeds of the
special tax. The special tax and corresponding increase in
the appropriations limit expire on June 30, 2011.
