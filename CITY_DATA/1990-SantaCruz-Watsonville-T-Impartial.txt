IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
MEASURE T

The Board of Supervisors of the County of Santa Cruz has submitted to the
voters of the County a measure ("Measure E”) at the November 6, 1990,
General Election to levy an additional one-half cent transaction and use tax
(“sales tax") pursuant to Section 7285 of the Revenue and Taxation Code,
the sates tax, if Measure "E" is passed by a majority of voters county-wide
would become effective on April 1, 1991, and continue for six years after its
operative date.

Article XIII, Section 29, of the California Constitution and Sections 55700,
et seq of the California Government Code authorizes cities and counties to
enter into contracts for sharing sales tax revenues subject to approval of the
voters. The County of Santa Cruz has requested and the City of Watsonville
has agreed to enter Into a contract for sharing of sales tax revenues pursuant
to Government Code Section 55700 et seq in order to apportion the tax
revenues and provide for their equitable distribution if Measure “E" passes.

However, the contract to share sales tax revenue would not be operative
until this measure, now before the qualified electors of the City of Watsonville, is approved by a majority of those voting on this measure.

During the first year the sales tax proceeds will be distributed based upon
population. Thereafter the proceeds will be distributed pursuant to fixed
percentages based upon need. Under the terms of the proposed contract the
City of Watsonville would receive 13.1% of the sales tax proceeds or an
estimated $1,212,000.00 for the first year. During the second through sixth
years, the City of Watsonville will receive 38.9% of the sales tax proceeds or
an estimated $13,000,000.00 pursuant to the contract.

If the voters of the City of Watsonville or any other City signing the contract
do not vote to approve the proposed contract, then that City’s share will be
distributed, based upon population, to the other parties to the contract whose
voters approve the contract.
