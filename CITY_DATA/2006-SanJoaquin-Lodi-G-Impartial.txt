IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE G
Prepared by Lodi City Attorney

The Fire and Facilities Sales Tax Initiative proposes to amend
the Lodi Municipal Code to add new Chapter 3.09 adding an
additional one quarter cent transaction and use (sales) tax.
The tax would be paid in addition to current State and local
sales taxes and would be collected at the same time, in the
same manner, and on the same items as sales taxes. The
sales tax levy must be approved by a two-thirds vote of the
qualified voters in the City voting in an election on the issue.
If approved, the sales tax levy would become effective April 1,
2007 and would remain in effect for ten years. City staff has
conservatively estimated that the measure would raise
$28,585 million dollars over its ten-year life.

The initiative requires that the proceeds of the tax be spent on
the following projects in the following priority:

1.	Placing paramedics on fire engines in Lodi (up to
$700,000 per year for six years, total of $4,200,000);

2.	Design and construction of Fire Station #5 which
shall be located in the southeast portion of Lodi (up
to $2,000,000);

3.	Construction of the Lodi Aquatics Center (up to
$9,000,000);

4.	Design and construction of a replacement for Fire
Station #2, which shall be located in the eastern
portion of Lodi (up to $2,000,000);

5.	Construction of a downtown indoor sports center (up
to $9,000,000); and

6.	Maintenance and operation of the facilities above (up
to $1,500,000).

The initiative requires that the proceeds be spent on the
above projects and no others. After year ten, the funding
from the initiative to maintain these facilities and programs
would cease.

The initiative also establishes an oversight committee to
ensure that the proceeds are spent on the listed projects.
The oversight committee would also have the power to, jointly
with the City Council, approve proposed changes in the
priority or maximum expense of projects based upon changed
circumstances.
