MEASURE Z2012
City of Solvang
IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY

If approved by the voters, Measure Z2012 would amend the Solvang
Municipal Code to increase the tax paid by temporary occupants of
rooms two percentage points. This measure would set the transient
occupancy tax rate at twelve percent (12%). At this rate, for example, a
stay in a hotel $100 in value would generate a tax of twelve dollars.
The tax is not imposed upon the hotel or motel owner but is imposed
upon the temporary, or 'â€˜transient", occupant The owner of the hotel or
motel does have a duty to both collect the tax from the occupant and to
remit the tax to the City of Solvang.

This measure requires all proceeds of the tax to be deposited into the
City's General Fund to be used for such general municipal
governmental purposes as the City Council shall direct. Among such
purposes are police services, tourism related services, public bathroom
construction and maintenance, street and sidewalk construction,
maintenance and repair, pothole repair, and storm drain construction,
maintenance and repair. It is estimated that this increase will generate
Five Hundred Thousand ($500,000.00) or more additional revenue on
an annual basis from the visitors that will pay the tax.

The transient occupancy tax increase proposed by this measure will
only become effective if approved by a majority of those electors voting
on the measure.

A YES vote approves the measure.

A NO vote rejects the measure
