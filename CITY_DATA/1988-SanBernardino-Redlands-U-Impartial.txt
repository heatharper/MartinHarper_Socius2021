MEASURE “U”

ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY

Pursuant to Chapter 3.24 of the Redlands Municipal Code, the City of Redlands imposes
a transient occupancy tax upon all persons who rent rooms in hotels located within the City.
The amount of the tax is five percent (5%) of the rent charged by the operator of the hotel
and revenue generated by the tax is deposited into the City’s general fund.

Ordinance No. 2041, if approved, would increase the transient occupancy tax from five
percent (5%) to nine percent (9%) of the rent charged by the operator of a hotel. Ordinance
No. 2041 would further require that the amount of revenue resulting from the tax increase
be deposited into a special fund designated for visitor and cultural arts promotion within
the City of Redlands. The City estimates that the revenues generated for visitor and cultural
arts promotion by this proposed tax increase will be One Hundred Eight Thousand Dollars
($108,000.00).
