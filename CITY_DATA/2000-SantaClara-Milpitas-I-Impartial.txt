CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE I

This initiative measure will amend Section 111-13.3.00 of the Milpitas Municipal Code. Section III. Chapter 3 of the Milpitas Municipal Code sets forth the provisions of the City's Transient Occupancy Tax. A Transient Occupancy Tax is a tax paid by a hotel guest when the guest rents a hotel room. Tho hotel operator collects this tax from its guests and transmits tho funds to the City. The tax proceeds are placed into the City's General Fund to be used by the City for general city purposes and services as determined by the City Council. Municipal Code Section III-13.3.00 currently sets this tax at a rate of eight percent (8%) of the rent charged by the hotel operator.

This initiative measure will, if approved by a majority of the voters, amend Section
111-13.3.00 of tho Milpitas Municipal Code by raising the City’s Transient Occupancy Tax rate from eight percent (3%) of tho room rate charged to ten percent (10%) of the room rate charged. If this initiative measure is approved, voter approval would be required to further amend or repeal the provisions approved by this initiative measure.
