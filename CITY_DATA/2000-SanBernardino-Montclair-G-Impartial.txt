MEASURE “G”

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS

This measure provides that each household and business located in the City of
Montclair shall pay $2 per month to cover the cost of starting and operating a
paramedic program by the City of Montclair. The $2 monthly fee would be a
special tax as it is being imposed for the specific purpose of providing paramedic
services by the City of Montclair. Collection of the tax would begin May 1, 2000.
Passage of a special tax under current law requires two-thirds (2/3) vote of the
electorate voting in an election on the tax. The monthly fee cannot be increased
without further voter approval.
