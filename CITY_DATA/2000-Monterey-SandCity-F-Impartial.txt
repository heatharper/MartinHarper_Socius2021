IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
CITY OF SAND CITY MEASURE F

The Sand City Municipal Code presently imposes a tax on rental
of hotel rooms in the City which is commonly referred to as a "transient
occupancy tax." The existing rate of the tax is 8% of the amount
charged for the hotel room. A majority vote in favor of this proposition
would enable the Sand City Council to act at any time to increase
or decrease the rate of transient occupancy tax charged in Sand City
from a minimum of 8% to a maximum of 14%. If this measure fails
to pass, the City Council will not have the authority to increase the
rate of the tax above 8%.
