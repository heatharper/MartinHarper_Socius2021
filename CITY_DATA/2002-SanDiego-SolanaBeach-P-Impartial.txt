CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS

Proposition P Is a measure to increase the City of Solana Beach fire benefit fee to an amount not to
exceed $25.00 per benefit unit per year. A yes vote is a vote to increase the fire benefit fee to an
amount not to exceed $25.00 per benefit unit per year. A no vote is a vote to keep the fire benefit fee
at its current level of not to exceed $10.00 per benefit unit per year.

In 1980 the citizens of Solana Beach voted to approve a fire benefit fee not to exceed $10.00 per
benefit unit per year in the Solana Beach Fire Protection District (“SBFPD") as provided for in its
Ordinance No. 6-1. In 1986, the City of Solana Beach merged with the Solana Beach Fire
Protection District and was authorized to continue to levy the fire benefit fee. The fire benefit fee has
been levied at the maximum approved rate of $10.00 per unit of benefit since 1990.

In July 2002. after a public hearing, the City Council adopted Resolution No. 2002-71 placing
Proposition P on the ballot. If Proposition P passes, the City of Solana Beach will be able to levy the
fire benefit fee at a rate not to exceed $25.00 per benefit unit per year. As with the currently
approved fire benefit fee, the actual annual rate will be established by the City Council prior to
August 10 of each year. The County of San Diego will collect the fee in the same manner as other
property taxes and fees. The fire benefit fee can only be used to provide fire protection and
suppression services and advanced life support medical services. All fire benefit fees must be
deposited Into a separate City account and the City must provide an annual report containing the
amount of the fire benefit fees collected and expended.
