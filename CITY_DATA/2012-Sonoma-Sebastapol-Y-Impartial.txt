CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE Y

The City Council of the City of Sebastopol has placed Measure Y on the November
6,2012 ballot to ask the voters to approve an ordinance that would enact a temporary additional one half of one percent (.5%) sales tax within the City. If approved,
the tax would add a half cent to the price of an item that costs one dollar. Sales
taxes are levied on the sale or use of tangible personal property sold at retail. Retailers collect the tax at the time of sale and remit the funds to the State Board of
Equalization, which administers the tax.

The taxon retail sales in Sebastopol is 8.25% of the purchase price. This Measure,
if approved by the voters, would authorize an additional one half of one percent
(.5%) sales tax (officially referred to as a "retail transactions and use tax), which
would increase the total sales tax rate on retail sales in Sebastopol from 8.25% to
8.75%.

The full amount of the revenue generated by this Measure would go into the City’s
general fund and be available to support the full range of municipal services. Because this Measure does not limit the use of tax revenue, it is a "general tax", not a
“special tax” that restricts funds to specific purposes. Therefore, as explained in
the ballot question, the City may use the funds for a range of services and projects,
including without limitation, services such as police, fire, street and road maintenance and repairs, flood prevention, park and open space maintenance, and other
general community services.

The tax would automatically terminate 8 years after collection begins. A "Yes" vote
is a vote to approve the enactment of the .5% tax for 8 years. A "No" vote is a vote
against the tax. The Measure would be approved if it receives a simple majority of
"Yes" votes.
