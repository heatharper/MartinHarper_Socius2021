CITY ATTORNEY’S ANALYSIS OF PROPOSITION N

The ballot proposition submitted to the voters seeks to validate and approve the
city’s utility user tax.

The utility user tax is a tax on the use of telephone, electricity, natural gas and
water services in the city. The tax is paid by the consumer as part of the utility
bill.

Proposition N reduces the maximum tax from 8% to 2%. The City Council can
reduce and adjust the rate of the tax from time to time, but can never increase
the tax above the 2% cap.

The utility user tax is a general tax. General taxes are taxes not limited to a specific
purpose and are used for general city functions, such as police, fire and library
services as well as maintenance of streets and parks.

The ballot proposition is proposed in response to a recent California Supreme
Court decision. When the City Council adopted the utility user tax in 1993, courts
had ruled that general taxes could be adopted by the city council without a vote
of the electorate. The California Supreme Court recently overturned those earlier
decisions, holding that general taxes required voter approval. The City Council
has proposed this proposition to allow voters the opportunity to validate and
approve the utility users tax.

A yes vote on die proposition ratifies the past collection of the utility user tax and
authorizes the continued collection of the tax. A no vote will result in die due no
longer being collected and possible liability to the City to refund sums previously
collected under the existing utility user tax. The proposition will be adopted if it
is approved by a majority of the voters.
