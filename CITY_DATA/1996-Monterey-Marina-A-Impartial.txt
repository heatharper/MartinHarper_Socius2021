IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
CITY OF MARINA
UTILITY USER’S TAX MEASURE A

City of Marina Ballot Measure A presents to the electors the question of whether
the City's five percent (5%) Utility User’s Tax shall be extended for a period of two
(2) years.

The City Council previously adopted Chapter 3.14 of the Municipal Code which
imposes a five percent (5%) tax on the use of utilities and cable television within
the City effective August 1, 1993, and after an election of the citizens the tax was
extended until July 31, 1996. The Council has now unanimously voted to place the
matter of the tax's extension before the electorate at this time.

A ‘Yes’ vote on this ballot measure is a vote in favor of the City Council’s proposal
to extend the existing Utility User’s Tax for a period of two (2) years.

A ‘No’ vote is a vote against the extension of the existing Utility User’s Tax.

If the measure passes the City Council would then formally consider an ordinance
extending the tax for two (2) years. The tax will only be extended if it is approved
by the City Council.
