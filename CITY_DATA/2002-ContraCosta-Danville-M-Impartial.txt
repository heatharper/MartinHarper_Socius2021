CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS
BUSINESS LICENSE TAX MEASURE M

Measure M proposes to ratify and readopt the Town of Danville’s existing business license tax. The business license ordinance, including the tax, was adopted by the
Town Council in 1993. At the time the tax was adopted by the Town Council, the state courts had consistently held that general taxes, such as the business license tax,
could be adopted without voter approval. Subsequent decisions by the California Supreme Court interpreting the provisions of Proposition 62 now require that the
Town’s business license tax receive approval by the Town’s voters.

The ordinance requires all businesses located in the Town with annual gross revenues of at least $10,000 to obtain a license. The ordinance exempts nonprofit
organizations. The amount of the tax for most businesses is a flat $100 per year, plus $10 per full time equivalent employee over one. The tax for itinerant businesses
(such as carnivals or other temporary exhibitions) is $100 per day, for promoters of street fairs $150 per event and $150 per year for a promoter of annual marketplaces,
such as the Farmers Market.

In the fiscal Year ended June 30, 2001, the Town received approximately $285,000 in revenue from the business license tax. This represents approximately 2% of the
Town’s general fund revenues on an annual basis.

Measure M proposes to ratify the existing tax with no changes. If Measure M is approved, the business license tax could only be increased in the future with voter
approval. As a general tax, the measure requires approval by a simple majority of those voting.

A yes vote on Measure M would ratify the existing tax and allow the Town to continue to receive the revenue generated by the tax. A no vote would repeal the existing
tax, with the resulting loss of revenue to the Town.
