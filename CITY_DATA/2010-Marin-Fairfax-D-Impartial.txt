TOWN ATTORNEYâ€™S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS
OF MEASURE D

TOWN OF FAIRFAX
SPECIAL TAX FOR PARAMEDIC SERVICES

If this measure is approved by a two-thirds vote, the special tax for paramedic services administered by a Joint
Powers Authority originally authorized by the voters on
June 7, 1983 and recommended by the voters on November
6, 1998, will be continued with a tax of $42.50 increasing
by $3.00 per year not to exceed $51.50 in the fourth year
for each taxable living unit or per 1,500 square feet of
structure of each developed parcel in non-residential use.
By approval of this Measure the appropriations limit
established in the Town of Fairfax pursuant to Article XIII
B of the California Constitution will be increased in an
amount equal to the proceeds of the special tax. The special tax and corresponding increase in the appropriations
limit expire on June 30, 2015.
