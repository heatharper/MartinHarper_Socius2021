MEASURE“M”

ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY

This ballot measure arises from initiative petition and submits to the voters the question of
whether the City’s utility user tax should be repealed.

The passage of this Measure would effect existing law by repealing Montclair Ordinance No.
91-702, as amended. Ordinance No. 91-702, as amended, currently provides for a utility
user’s tax of 4.74% on specified utilities, with an exemption for low-income residential users.
In 1995, the original rate of 5% was reduced to 4.74% as a result of the City Council’s
adoption of an adjustment formula for decreasing the utility user’s tax as sales tax revenues
increase. The defeat of this Measure would have no effect on existing law and would leave
Ordinance No. 91-702, as amended, in full force and effect. The passage of this Measure
would repeal Ordinance No. 91-702, as amended, in its entirety.
