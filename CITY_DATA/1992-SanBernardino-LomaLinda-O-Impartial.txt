ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY

In Measure O the City Council of the City of Loma Linda seeks the advice of the voters
regarding formation of a benefit assessment district to raise money to acquire, develop,
improve and maintain local parks, recreation and open space facilities for the City. The vote
on this measure is not binding on the City Council but rather serves to be advice of how the
voters respond to the issue.

The City Council has the authority to initiate special assessment districts pursuant to the
1911,1913, and 1915 Acts contained in the Streets and Highways Code. Such districts are
available to finance special benefit facilities where a direct and specific benefit can be
established between the improvement and specific parcels of real property. A protest hearing
is held and no election is required. The Measure, if implemented, would include the entire
City in such an assessment district.

This measure asks for a response to raising a principal amount of ten (10) million dollars
for the described facilities. In addition to the principal amount there are costs associated with
obtaining bond financing such as interest, legal fees, and other costs. A bonded
indebtedness will be paid off over a period of years which typically range from fifteen (15)
to twenty-five (25) years. During the life of the bond each benefited parcel of real property
will be assessed an amount. The measure gives a hypothetical example of the annual
assessment for a typical single family household. The amount included in the Measure is
an assumed amount and will vary by the benefit spread of an assessment district.

The City now pays for park, recreation and open space facilities out of its general fund. An
assessment district would provide additional funds for such facilities.

Section 5011 of the Elections Code requires City Attorney to prepare an impartial analysis of measures appearing on the
ballot.
