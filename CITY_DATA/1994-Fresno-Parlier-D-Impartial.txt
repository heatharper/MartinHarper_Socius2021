CITY OF PARLIER SPECIAL TAX
MEASURE D

(Impartial Analysis by City Attorney)

California law allows a city council to adopt a special tax for fire and police protection purposes. Such a tax must
be approved by a vote of two-thirds of the voters. If approved by the voters, the proceeds of the special tax may
only be used for fire and police protection purposes. This ballot measure, if approved by two-thirds of the Parlier
voters in the November, 1994 general election, will authorize the imposition of a special tax on all parcels of real
property within the City of Parlier. The amount of the annual special tax will be $108 per parcel ($9 per month) on
all parcels of property within the City except parcels owned by public agencies. The tax will be collected on the tax
roils by the County of Fresno along with property taxes. The proposed special tax may not be increased by the
Parlier City Council unless approved by a future vote of the voters. If this ballot measure is approved by the voters
of the City of Parlier, the proceeds of the special tax can only be used to pay for police and fire protection services
for the residents of the City of Parlier. If approved, the tax will go into effect in fiscal year 1995.
