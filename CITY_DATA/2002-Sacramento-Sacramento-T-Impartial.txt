Prepared by the City Attorney

Effect of Measure on Existing Law

- Measure T is an initiative measure that would amend the Utility User Tax
(“UUT”) of the City of Sacramento (“City”).

Currently, the UUT is imposed on City residents’ use of telephone, electricity,
natural gas, and cable television utilities. The tax rate is 7.5% of the charges on
utility bills. The revenue from the UUT is placed in the City’s General Fund, which is
used to fund police, fire, parks, recreation and other city services.

Measure T would reduce the UUT rate from 7.5% to 2.5% over four years,
beginning July 1,2003.

. Currently, persons who are sixty-two or older or disabled, and whose annual
household income is less than $25,000, are eligible for a partial UUT refund.

Measure T would amend the UUT refund program to eliminate the age and
disability eligibility requirements. The income requirement would remain
unchanged.
