Impartial Analysis from City Attorney
This measure would authorize $22,500,000 in special tax bonds and a special tax to make debt 
service payments and pay for pool maintenance and aquatics programs, and permit expenditure 
of those funds.
This measure will pass or fail as a whole.

Bonds
Bond proceeds would be used to: construct a replacement indoor multipurpose warm pool 
expected to be 2250 square feet and associated facilities and locker rooms, and renovate the 
existing pool and associated facilities, at West Campus (and possibly consolidate locker 
rooms); construct an all-purpose, 25-meter size pool with wading area, locker rooms and 
associated facilities at King School; and renovate the existing outdoor pools, locker rooms 
and associated facilities at Willard School.

Special Tax
The special tax authorized by this measure would be levied on the square footage of 
improvements to real property throughout City of Berkeley Community Facilities District No. 2 
(Berkeley Pools) ("CFD No. 2"). CFD No. 2 includes the entire City of Berkeley. The tax would 
have two parts.

Bond Repayment
The first part of the special tax would secure and repay the bonds, and would be levied for a 
period of 30 years, from fiscal year 2011 through fiscal year 2040. Its maximum rate will be 
$0.0258 per square foot of improvements. Once the bond is repaid this part of the tax will 
terminate.

Aquatic Programs/Pools Operation and Maintenance
The second part of the special tax would pay for the anticipated gap between current funding 
and the funding necessary to continue to support existing pool maintenance and aquatics 
programs, and for enhanced aquatics programs. This part of the tax would be levied at an 
initial rate of $0.0039 per square foot of improvements in 2010 and 2011, and $0.0126 in 2012, 
subject to annual increases by the greater of the increase in the cost of living for the 
immediate San Francisco Bay Area or per capita personal income growth in California.

Appropriations Limit
This measure would establish an appropriations limit of $3,500,000 for CFD No. 2, to allow 
the proceeds of the special tax to be spent.

Financial Implications
The year after the first bonds are issued, the tax rate required to meet the estimated debt 
service and fund aquatic programs and pools operation would be $0.0297 per square foot. This 
rate is projected to peak at approximately $0.0423 in 2040 (bond repayment plus indexed 
programs and maintenance tax), and average $0.0369 per square foot during the 30 year issue.
The cost in 2010 dollars for an average size 1,900 square foot home until the bonds are 
repaid, including the tax for maintenance and aquatic programs, is estimated as follows:

Square Feet Annual Tax
First year Average
(Residential) 1,900 $56.43 $ 70.06
(Commercial) 10,000 $297.00 $ 368.76

After the bonds are repaid in FY 2040 the tax rate in 2010 dollars for maintenance and 
aquatic programs would be $0.0126, subject to an annual inflation adjustment, yielding 
annual costs in 2010 dollars as shown below:
Square Feet Annual Tax
(Residential) 1,900 $ 24.02
(Commercial) 10,000 $ 26.40
