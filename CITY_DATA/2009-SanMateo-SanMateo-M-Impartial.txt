Impartial Analysis of Measure M	

If approved by a majority of the voters, Measure M will authorize
an additional two percent (2%) tax on transient occupancy (commonly
referred to as a “hotel tax”) to be levied within the City of San Mateo. This
additional hotel tax would be a “general tax,” meaning that the revenue
raised from the tax would go into the City’s general fund and may be used
for any municipal governmental purpose. Municipal governmental purposes
may include police and fire protection, library facilities, public works,
street maintenance and repair, programs for seniors, parks and recreation
services, and other governmental functions and services. The measure does
not bind the City to use the proceeds of the tax for any particular services,
facilities, or programs.

The City of San Mateo currently imposes a 10% hotel tax. The
additional 2% hotel tax authorized by this measure would be levied and
collected at the same time and in the same manner as the existing hotel
tax.

State law authorizes the City of San Mateo to levy this additional
2% hotel tax following approval by two-thirds of the City Council and a
majority of the voters voting in an election on that issue. The San Mateo
City Council unanimously approved this tax on July 13, 2009.

If approved by a majority of the voters at the November 3, 2009
election, the additional 2% hotel tax would become operative 10 days
after the date the election results are officially declared final by the City
Council.

A YES vote approves the measure.

A NO vote rejects the measure.
