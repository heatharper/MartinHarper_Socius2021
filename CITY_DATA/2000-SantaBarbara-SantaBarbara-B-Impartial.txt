IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY

MEASURE B 

The City of Santa Barbara currently imposes a transient occupancy tax (commonly referred to as a hotel bed tax) upon any person who occupies a hotel room for 30 consecutive calendar days or less. The amount of the tax is equal to ten percent (10%) of the rent charged by the hotel operator. The passage or failure of Measure B2000 will not affect this existing tax.  

If Measure B is enacted an additional hotel bed tax would be imposed in the amount of two percent (2%) of the rent charged, so that the amount of hotel bed taxes payable by a person occupying a hotel room for 30 consecutive days or less would be increased from ten to twelve percent of the rent charged. All taxes received by the city from this additional two percent (2%) hotel bed tax would be deposited into a special fund and could be spent only for certain purposes related to the improvement of waters and creeks. Measure B specifies that the proceeds raised by the additional two percent (2%) hotel bed tax shall be used "to fund programs to improve the quality of storm waters and other surface waters discharged into the Pacific Ocean, to carry out creek restoration improvements, and for projects or programs to improve the quality of onshore or offshore waters.”  

Because any monies that are raised by the proposed additional hotel bed tax can be spent only for specified purposes the tax proposed by Measure B is a special tax rather than a general tax. Under the California Constitution special taxes may not be enacted unless approved by a two-thirds vote of the electorate. Accordingly, a two-thirds “yes” vote on Measure B is required to authorize this additional hotel bed tax.
