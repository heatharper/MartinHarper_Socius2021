Summary Prepared by City Attorney
This proposed ordinance raises revenue to fund 911 response and dispatch, police and fire services, police investigations and violence prevention programs in the City of Oakland.
The revenue will come from a temporary new parcel tax, which runs through July 2016.
The City may use the revenue for 911 police and fire response and dispatch, community and neighborhood policing, park policing, and police investigations and oversight. With respect to the revenue raised by this temporary parcel tax, a minimum of 75 percent of all moneys appropriated must be appropriated for these police and fire services.
The City may also use tax proceeds for violence prevention services, including but not limited to outreach workers.
The parcel tax will be $360.00 for a single family residential parcel, $245.95 for each unit in a multi-family residential parcel. For non-residential parcels, the parcel tax varies depending on the frontage, area and use of the property. See the formula at Part 3, Section 2(c). There is an exemption for low income households.
