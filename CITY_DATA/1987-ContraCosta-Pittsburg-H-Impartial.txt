CITY ATTORNEYâ€™S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF
THE PITTSBURG MUNICIPAL SERVICES TAX MEASURE
(Elections Code Section 5011)

The municipal services tax measure seeks to amend the Municipal Code to authorize the levy of a tax on parcels of real
property within the City. The measure provides that the revenues may be used for increased police services, street maintenance, street
lighting, parks, landscaping, building maintenance, recreation, leisure services, and other municipal services.

If approved, the tax will be collected each year on the secured roll property tax bill. The proposed tax is $52 for each
unimproved residential parcel, $104 for each dwelling unit on a residential parcel, $364 for each unimproved commercial parcel and
$364 for each business unit on a commercial parcel. The tax would become effective beginning with fiscal year 1987-1988.

The proposed tax is a general tax and under state law may be imposed if it is approved by a majority of the voters voting
in the election on the measure. If approved the measure could not be changed (and the amount of tax could not be increased) without
a majority vote in another election.

The Effect of the Measure on Existing Law

In 1985, the City Council adopted Ordinance No. 85-868 and Resolution No. 85-6940 imposing a municipal services tax in
the City. That tax has been collected on the tax rolls for the past two years, but will expire on June 30, 1987 unless extended by this
measure. The existing tax is $36 for each unimproved residential parcel, $72 for each dwelling unit on a residential parcel and $252
for each parcel zoned for commercial or industrial use. If approved, the ballot measure would continue the municipal services tax, with
adjustments in the amount of the tax.
