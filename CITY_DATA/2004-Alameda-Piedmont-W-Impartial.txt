Impartial Analysis from Piedmont City Attorney
CITY ATTORNEY'S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE W The new Municipal Services Tax that is being placed before Piedmont voters on November 2 is a continuation of a number of prior similar measures over the last 20 years aimed at providing additional funds to insure the level of City services that Piedmonters have grown accustomed to expect, including superior police, fire and emergency medical services.
It provides for an average tax level approximately 49% higher than the current Municipal Services Tax that expires on June 30, 2005, and is expected to raise in the neighborhood of $1,385,000 to assist with funding important City services. The new tax rates were approved by the City Council to further reduce the City budget and City expenses for the 2004-2005 fiscal year.
If the new Municipal Services Tax measure is not approved on November 2, it is clear that in order to operate on other than a deficit basis, significant reductions will be required in City services.
