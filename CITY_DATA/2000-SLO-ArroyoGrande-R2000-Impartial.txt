IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
MEASURE R

Measure R asks voters to decide if the City of Arroyo Grande
("City") should increase the Transient Occupancy Tax rate from 6%
to 10%. The Transient Occupancy Tax, also called the hotel/motel
bed tax, is a tax charged to people who stay in hotels, motels and
inns for thirty (30) days or less. An increase in trie Transient Occupancy
Tax rate from 6% to 10% will result in approximately $130,000 in
additional revenue annually to the City. Revenue from the Transient
Occupancy Tax is used to pay for general City services such as street
maintenance, fire protection and police services.
