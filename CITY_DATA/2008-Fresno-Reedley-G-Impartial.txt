IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY  


“On November 7, 2007, the Reedley City Council adopted Ordinance No. 2007-05, which establishes a new sales and use tax on all taxable transactions within the City of Reedley. 

Measure “G” seeks voter approval of the new sales tax described in Ordinance No. 2007-05 because state law does not allow the imposition of a new sales tax by City Council action alone; voter approval is also required by law. The amount of the sales and use tax is one-half of one percent (1/2 of 1%) and the sales and use tax will be added to other existing sales taxes by retail and other vendors and charged and collected in the same way in which traditional sales taxes are charged and collected. 

The proposed sales and use tax can only be used for a limited list of expenditures that are consistent with a detailed “Expenditure Plan” which is a part of Ordinance No. 2007-05. The Expenditure Plan describes, in detail the type of expenditures that will be allowed for public safety purposes, programs and purchases. The Ordinance also establishes a five member Citizen Oversight Committee whose responsibility it is to make annual reviews of the expenditures of the sales tax revenues in order to ensure that they are spent in a manner consistent with the Expenditure Plan. The Citizens Oversight Committee is also required to make an annual public report regarding the expenditures of the proceeds of the tax by the City. Passage of Ballot Measure “G” requires two-thirds voter approval. If approved by the voters, the special sales tax would become effective on July 1, 2008, and continue until repealed by the voters of the City of Reedley. The Ordinance requires the Citizens Oversight Committee and the Council to review the tax measure every ten years.”
