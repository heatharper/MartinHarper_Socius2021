IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
MEASURE A

Since at least 1965, the City of Red Bluff has imposed a Transient
Occupancy Tax ("TOT’) on “transients" (guests) for the privilege of
occupancy at “hotels” within the City. "Hotel" is broadly defined for
TOT purposes to include a wide variety of lodgings for transients.
Each hotel operator collects the TOT from the hotel’s transient guests
and remits the TOT to the City. Transient occupancies are generally
occupancies that last for 30 days or less and are not contracted for
more than 30 days.

A taxpayer has questioned whether the TOT applies to transient
occupancies of camping sites and spaces at campgrounds and
recreational vehicle parks. The City believes that, under existing law,
the TOT does apply to these sorts of transient occupancies. This
measure would clarify the definition of "hotel" to ensure that such
occupancies are taxable and would declare that such definition is
reflective of existing law.

This Measure would add a new Section 21.22 to the Municipal Code
to read:

"§21.22. CAMPING SITES, CAMPGROUNDS AND RECREATIONAL
VEHICLE PARKS.

(A)	For purpose of this Article III of Chapter 21 of the Municipal
Code, relating to the Transient Occupancy Tax, “hotel” shall be deemed
to include camping sites and spaces at campgrounds and recreational
vehicle parks, so long as such camping sites and spaces are occupied
by transients or intended or designed for occupancy by transients
for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes.

(B)	Nothing in this Section 21.22 is intended to cause any
person who actually exercises occupancy of a camping sites or
space at a campground or recreational vehicle park for a period in
excess of thirty consecutive days to pay a tax with respect to the
rent for any such excess days."

A YES vote approves the measure.

A NO vote rejects the measure.
