IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE J

Existing California law authorizes cities to collect a general excise tax
on the privilege of operating a business within the City (“business license
tax”). The City of South San Francisco has previously adopted Ordinance
No. 720 which provides for the imposition and collection of a business
license tax to be paid by owners and operators of businesses located in the
City.

Measure J would impose a special business license tax on those
persons, firms, corporations or companies owning or operating
off-premises advertising signs where such signs are located within the City
and contain equal to or greater than 250 square feet of advertising copy.
The amount of tax would be eight percent (8%) of the gross receipts
obtained from advertising on the billboards located in the City. The
ordinance under consideration as part of Measure J also establishes
procedures for the payment of the tax. Measure J does not modify any
other existing business license tax in South San Francisco.

The tax revenues from the special business license tax proposed as part
of Measure J may only be used for park, library, recreation and public
safety services. Thus, the tax proposed in Measure J is a special tax under
California law and therefore requires that two-thirds of the voters approve
Measure J for the special tax to be adopted.
