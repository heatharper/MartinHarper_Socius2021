IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE G

Measure G, if approved by a majority vote, would allow the Daly City
Utility Users Tax to continue to be collected as it has in the past. The tax
would continue to be applied at the rate of five percent (5%) on
communications services (telephone, cellular, cable), gas, and electric
services.

If adopted by the voters, the tax cannot be increased or changed without a
vote of Daly City voters.

Several exemptions to the tax exist: exemption for low income seniors,
exemption for blind persons and exemption for disabled persons. The tax
would not be levied against persons or entities exempt by state or federal
law, including public schools. The Measure will also update the existing
17 year old ordinance language referencing technology and
telecommunications services, and include amended federal and state
regulations that have been enacted since the original adoption of the City’s
Utility Users Tax.

The utility users tax is a general tax. All revenue generated by the tax
would go to the City’s general fund to provide essential governmental
services including, but not limited to: police, fire, libraries, public works,
parks, recreation programs including recreation programs for seniors and
youth, and other essential local government services. It is estimated that
the tax will generate approximately $6,000,000 of the City’s general fund
budget of $66,000,000 for fiscal year 2006-2007.

This measure must be approved by a majority of the voters.
