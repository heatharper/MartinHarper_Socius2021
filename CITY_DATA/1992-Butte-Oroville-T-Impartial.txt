CITY ATTORNEY'S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS
REGARDING CITY CODE SECTION 24-104
MEASURE T

Section 24-104 of the Oroville City Code presently imposes a tax of Six (6%) percent
of the amount of the rent on each transient who occupies a hotel or motel room within the
City. A transient is defined in City Code section 24-103 as a person who occupies such a
room for a period less than thirty 130 consecutive days. All monies collected are deposited
in the City's general fund.

Measure "T", if approved by the voters, would make several substantive changes to Section
24-104. The rate of tax would be increased to Nine (9%) and the tax collected would be
divided between the City's general fund, which would receive one-half of the tax monies collected,
a separate fund to be utilized solely for a Visitor/Tourism program which would receive thirty-
seven and one-half (37.5%) percent and a separate fund to be utilized solely for Community
Promotions, which would receive the other twelve and one-half 112.5%) percent.

Since this measure would impose a tax for a special purpose, i.e. for a Visitor Tourism
program and a Community Promotions program, the approval of two-thirds of the voters is
required for passage pursuant to section 53722 of the California Government Code.
