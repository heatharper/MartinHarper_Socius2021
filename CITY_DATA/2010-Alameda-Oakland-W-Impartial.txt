Summary Prepared by City Attorney
This proposed ordinance would amend the Oakland Municipal Code to establish a new Telephone Access Line Tax at a rate of $1.99 per month per "access line" and $13 per month per "trunk line." The $1.99 tax per month per "access line" applies to basic residential and business services, as well as to mobile telephones. The $13 tax per month per "trunk line" applies to telephone lines connecting two telephone exchanges directly. Neither tax would apply to eligible low-income residential customers or to those customers where application of the tax would violate state and/or federal law.
The revenue from the tax will be deposited in the City's General Fund and can to be used for any municipal governmental purpose.
This measure must be approved by a majority of the voters who cast ballots (50% plus one).
