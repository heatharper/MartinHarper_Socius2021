IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE L

This measure, if approved by two-thirds (2/3) of the voters voting on the
measure, will extend the current Library Special Tax for five (5) years (from July
1, 2011 through June 30, 2016) and any further extension must be approved by
two-thirds (2/3) of the voters voting on such extension at another municipal
election.

Currently, pursuant to Section 2.89-4 of the South Pasadena Municipal Code,
any revenue generated by the special tax can only be used for maintenance,
operating, and administrative costs of the Library. That restricted use of the
special tax revenue would continue to apply if the measure is adopted.

The annual rate by category for the special tax would also continue at the current
rates, approved by the voters in March of 1999 as follows:

1. Single family residence and condominiums pay $24.00 if they are less than

2,000	square feet; $36.00 if between 2,001 and 4,000 square feet; $48.00 if
over 4,000 square feet. â€œSquare feet" refers to square feet of Building Areas
as determined by the Los Angeles County Assessor.

2.	Multi-family residential units, such as apartment buildings, pay $12.00 per
Dwelling Unit on the parcel.

3.	Non-residential parcels pay $24.00 per parcel if one-quarter (1/4) acre or less;
$48.00 per parcel if over one-quarter (1/4) acre to one-half (1/2) acre; $72.00
per parcel if over one-half (1/2) acre to three-quarters (3/4) acre; $96.00 per
parcel if more than three-quarters (3/4) acre.

4.	The following types of property would remain exempt from the tax:

a.	Parcels owned by charitable or community service organizations or churches
that qualify for an exemption from ad valorem taxation under California law.

b.	Vacant parcels.

c.	Parcels owned by the federal, state or local government, or any state or local
agency.

d.	Any owner who has income, adjusted for family size, at or below eighty
percent (80%) of the area median income as determined under the Section 8
Income Limits for Los Angeles County. (These limits are published by the
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.)

The following restrictions would also continue if the measure is passed:

If in any year the City Council does not budget and appropriate sufficient funds
for the basic level of library services, the special tax would be fixed at a reduced
level in relation to any reduction in the budget.

Any surplus amounts raised by the special tax in any one year may only be used
for the purposes described in South Pasadena Municipal Code Section 2.89-4,
and must be carried over to the following fiscal year. The existence of a surplus
in one year must be considered by the City in levying the special tax for the next
year.

The special tax will continue to be collected by the Los Angeles County Assessor
in the same manner as property taxes.
