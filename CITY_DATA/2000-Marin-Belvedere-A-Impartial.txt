IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
MEASURE A

City of Belvedere
Continuation of Existing Fire and
Emergency Medical Services Levy

This ballot measure authorizes the continuance of the City’s levy for
fire protection and emergency medical services for the period July 1,
2000 through June 30,2004.

The maximum amount that can be derived from this levy may not
exceed the rate currently authorized in Chapter 3,28 of the Belvedere
Municipal Code. The amount of the levy will result in the following rate
structure for the fiscal year 1999/2000: $244,00 per residential dwelling
unit; $306.00 per commercial occupancy; and $70.00 per vacant parcel
of land. Pursuant to Article XIIIB of the California Constitution, the
amount of the proceeds derived from this levy may be adjusted each
year by percentage changes in the Consumer’s Price Index as well as
the population of the City.

Continuation of this levy will increase the City’s appropriations limit to
the extent of the proceeds derived therefrom, and Article XIIIB of the
California Constitution requires the continuation of this levy be approved
by a majority of the electors voting on the measure on April 11,2000.

A “Yes” vote on this measure authorizes the City to continue its levy for
fire protection and emergency medical services for four more years
commencing July 1,2000.

A “No” vote on this measure prohibits the City from continuing its levy
for fire protection and emergency medical services after June 30,2000.
