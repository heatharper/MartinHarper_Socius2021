Piedmont Measure L is designed to provide funding for a continuation of the
paramedic services currently provided by the City. It provides for a special tax
in the exact amount of the previous assessment made by the homeowners to fund
the paramedic ambulance service in Piedmont.

This tax measure is necessitated by the requirements of Proposition 218,
which was passed by the Stateâ€™s voters in November, 1996. Piedmont, along with
Alameda County and a number of other cities within the County, is required to obtain voter approval for a continuation of the same $18.46 annual per household assessment which applied in Piedmont during 1996. This tax measure does
not increase the amount of this assessment.

The Paramedic Special Services Tax will be effective as of July 1, 1997, the
date when the current assessment ceases to apply under the provisions of
Proposition 218. It is anticipated that the tax measure will raise in the neighborhood of $71,000 in revenue to allow for the continued operation of paramedic
ambulance services by the City of Piedmont. Without this Paramedic Special
Services Tax the City will either have to find another funding source or curtail or
terminate the present paramedic ambulance service.
