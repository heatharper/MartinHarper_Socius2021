Section 4 of article 13A of the California Constitution grants
authority to Cities to levy and assess special taxes.

This measure, if passed by 2/3 (two-thirds) of the voters
voting at the general election, will levy and assess a special

will similarly tax all similarly zoned parcels in Manteca.

The measure sets a maximum tax for Districts RE, R-1 and R-
2 of $96.00 per parcel, District R-3 of $1,023,00 per acre or
$64.00 per dwelling unit, District R-4 of $1,543.00 per acre or
$64.00 per dwelling unit, Districts C-N, C-C, C-G, G-R, C-H,
C-B-D, C-0 and B-l-P of $750.00 per acre, Districts M-1 and
M-2 of $375.00 per acre, District O-S of $100.00 per acre and
District P-Q-P of $750.00 per acre, and empowers the City
Council to establish the amount of the special public safety
tax annually each fiscal year.

The revenues generated by this special tax may only be used
for police protection and fire protection and preventions which
include, but are not limited to, supplying equipment or
apparatus, paying salaries and benefits or for any other
necessary police protection expenses and fire protection and
prevention expenses of the City. Of the revenues generated
66% (sixty-six percent) shall be used for police protection and
34% (thirty-four percent) shall be used for fire protection and
prevention.

This tax will not be levied on any Federal or State
governmental agency or another local agency property that is
otherwise exempt.

This Ordinance can only be amended or repealed with the
approval of 2/3 (two-thirds) of the voters voting on the
provision at any initiative or referendums elections.

The City of Manteca finance department estimates that this
tax will generate a maximum amount of approximately
$3,610,000 annually.
