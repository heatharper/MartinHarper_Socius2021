IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
MEASURE A

Measure A, if approved by a majority vote, would reduce the City of Tulare Utility User’s Tax
on Communications from seven percent (7%) to six percent (6%), revise the method for
calculating and collecting that Tax to reflect technological advances and changes in State
and Federal Law, and ratify and approve the past collection of the Tax.

If approved by the voters, this Tax can not later be increased or changed without voter
approval.

The Measure will lower the tax rate from 7% to 6%. It will also update the existing ordinance
language to be consistent with changes in the technology of telecommunications services
and changes in State and Federal Laws and regulations enacted since the original adoption
of the Tax.

This Tax is a general tax and all revenues received would go to the City’s general fund to
provide essential services including, but not limited to: police, fire, streets, public works,
parks, recreation programs for seniors and youth, and the library. It is estimated that the Tax
will continue to provide approximately $1,400,000 for the 2007-2008 budget.

The Measure must be approved by a majority of the voters voting at this election.
