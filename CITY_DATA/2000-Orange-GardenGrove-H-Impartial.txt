IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
MEASURE H
CITY OF GARDEN GROVE

This ballot question asks whether a municipal ordinance should be enacted
providing for the increase in the transient occupancy tax from the existing
level of 10% to 13%. The transient occupancy tax (commonly referred to as
the ‘TOT” tax) is a general tax placed on the daily renting of hotel and motel
rooms by individuals, such as visitors to the city.

Under state law, any general tax increase must be approved by majority
vote of those voting on the proposed ballot question. The proposed
ordinance would also allow the City Council to enact future legislation
establishing tiered TOT taxes for different categories of room rates.
