IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY MEASURE T

The City of Yreka is proposing a Special Tax Measure to be submitted to the voters in the City of Yreka. The specific purpose for which the special tax is levied is to establish a stable source of funds within the City in order to fund training, wages and benefits of firefighters, acquire fire fighting equipment or rescue vehicles and for the improvement or construction of fire stations, substations, or training facilities. The tax can not be utilized for any other purpose.  The tax, if passed by a two-thirds vote of those voting on the measure, would be levied on each legal parcel in the City of Yreka having improvements of more than $10,000 as defined in the measure. The rate of the tax depends on use or square footage of improvements and ranges from $60 per year for single family and duplex residences to $350 for parcels having 7 or more business units or total structures exceeding 15,000 square feet. The Special Tax will not be levied on any property owned by the State of California, the Federal Government, or an agency or subdivision thereof. The Special Tax would be payable in monthly installments and would be collected in monthly installments at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary City water fees and shall be subject to the same penalties and the same procedure in the case of delinquency as provided for such fees.  The proposed Special Tax requires the approval of at least two- thirds of the voters voting upon the proposition, and, if approved, the Special Tax would thereafter appear as a separate item on the water bill issued monthly by the City of Yreka and would be payable on the first day of the month commencing the first month following the approval by the voters and certification by the City Council of the measure.  A "Yes" vote favors the passage of this Special Tax, while a "No‚Äù vote is against the passage of this Special Tax.
