IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY	


The Transit Occupancy Tax is a charge on all guests at hotels, motels, and other lodging places which is added to and collected form the charge for the room. This ballot measure will increase the charge from 8% of the room rate to 12%. An increase in the Transit Occupancy Tax will provide additional income to the City of Tehachapi which will accrue to the benefit of the City residents. On the other hand, it will increase the price for rooms at hotels, motels, and other lodging places within the City of Tehachapi.
