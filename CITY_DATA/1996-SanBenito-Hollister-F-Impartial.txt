UTILITY	USER’S	TAX	MEASURE	F

City of Hollister Measure F presents to the electors the question of whether the City’s two percent (2%) Utility User’s Tax shall be extended for a period of four (4) years.

The City Council adopted Ordinance No. 853 on October 17,
1994, which imposes a two percent (2%) tax on the use of utilities,
garbage disposal and cable television within the City. The City
Council has unanimously voted to place on the ballot the question
of whether the tax should be extended for a period of four (4)
years, beginning July 1, 1997.

A “Yes" vote on this ballot measure is a vote in favor of extending the existing two (2%) percent Utility User’s Tax for a period of four (4) years, beginning July 1, 1997.

A “No” vote is a vote against extending the Utility User's Tax beyond June 30, 1997,
if the measure passes, the City Council would then formally consider an ordinance extending the tax for four (4) years, beginning July 1, 1997. If a majority of the electorate vote against the measure, the City Council will repeal the Utility User's Tax effective June 30, 1997.
