IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
CITY OF DELANO
MEASURE H

This ballot measure, if adopted by the voters, would enact a temporary
twenty-year one-half percent (.5%) increase to the sales tax rate in the City of
Delano. The sales tax is also referred to as a “transactions and use tax.” The current sales tax rate in the City of Delano is seven and one-quarter percent (7.25%).
Accordingly, if this ballot measure is adopted, the sales tax rate would increase to
seven and three quarter percent (7.75%) for the next twenty years. The proposed increased sales tax, like the current sales tax, would be imposed upon the
sale of all tangible personal property sold at retail within the jurisdictional limits of
the City as well as upon the storage, use or other consumption of tangible personal property purchased from any retailer in the jurisdictional limits of the City.

All revenue generated from the proposed sales tax increase would be used by the
City to pay for street and road repairs. As such, this ballot measure proposes a
“special purpose tax” rather than a “general purpose tax” and requires a 2/3 majority vote for adoption.
