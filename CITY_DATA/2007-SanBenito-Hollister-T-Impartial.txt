Hollister City Attorney's Impartial Analysis of Measure T

A “Yes” vote on Measure T approves a one percent (1%) transactions and use tax,
commonly called a sales tax, on all retailers doing business in the city of Hollister.
The proposed tax would be collected in the same way as the current sales tax on
the sale of tangible personal property sold at retail and on the storage, use, or
other consumption of tangible personal property purchased from any retailer in
the City limits.

Measure T would impose a general tax as opposed to a special tax. Revenues
from the proposed sales tax would be deposited into the City’s general fond to be
used by the City for any city operation or service including anti-gang programs,
police and fire services, graffiti removal, park maintenance, and street
improvements.

Measure T would increase the sales tax rate in Hollister from 7.25% to 8.25%,
increasing the City’s portion of the sales tax from 0.75% to 1.75%. Measure T is
estimated to generate approximately $3.5 to 4 million in revenue each year.

If approved by the voters, the increased sales tax would take effect on the
operative date, expected to be April 1,2008. The sales tax will automatically
end five years from the operative date.

Under Measure T, the Mayor must appoint a citizens’ oversight committee to
review and report to the public annually on all sales tax revenues and expenses.

To become law, Measure T must be approved by 50% plus one vote of the
qualified voters in the City of Hollister.
