CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF
MEASURE G

Measure G would establish a utility user tax in the
City of Artesia. The utility user tax would apply to a
consumer’s use of electricity, natural gas, telephone, water,
and cable and satellite television services in the City. It
would also be extended to internet access charges if
subsequently authorized by state or federal law. The tax
would be levied on the charges made for the utility service
that appear on the consumer’s utility bill. It would be paid
by the consumer, collected by the utility and transmitted by
the utility to the City.

Measure G limits the amount of the tax to 5% of the
consumer’s utility charges. The City Council would be
authorized to reduce and adjust the rate of the tax from
time to time and make other changes to the ordinance but
the City Council could not increase the rate above the 5%
cap without voter approval.

Persons who are the head of a household and are
both sixty-two (62) years old or older and a recipient of
supplemental social security benefits, are eligible to apply
for an exemption to the tax. Specified exemptions also
apply to governmental and non-profit organizations.

The utility user tax is a general tax, the revenues
from which would be placed into the City’s General Fund,
and the City would be permitted to use the revenues for
any valid municipal purpose, such as police, fire and library
services as well as maintenance of streets and parks. As a
consequence, this measure would take effect only if
approved by a majority of those voting on the measure at
the November 2,1999 Special Municipal Election.
