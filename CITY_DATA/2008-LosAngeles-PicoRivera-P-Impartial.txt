The City of Pico Rivera like many other cities in Los Angeles County imposes a
general transactions and use tax (sales tax). The existing sales tax generates
revenues that are used to provide public services such as police and fire
protection, parks and recreation, library, public works, and other city programs
and services.

If adopted, Measure “P” will amend the provisions of the Pico Rivera City Code
to assess an additional one percent (1%) sales tax to fund general city services,
such as the hiring of additional police officers, fix and repair the condition of
neighborhood streets and major roads and highways, continue the effort to fight
gangs and drugs by expanding neighborhood graffiti removal programs, and
appropriate funds for the creation of youth anti-gang and anti-drug prevention
programs and after-school tutoring and mentoring programs. If adopted, the
funds generated will also be able to be used to be added to monies pledged by
the County of Los Angeles to assist in the construction of a high-tech community
library for the City of Pico Rivera.

The financial impact of this Measure, if approved, would add a one cent increase
for every dollar spent in Pico Rivera. Under California law, this one penny could
not be charged on prescriptions or food purchased as groceries.

A “Yes” vote on Measure “P” supports imposing a one percent (1%) sales tax to
generate funds for general city services. A “No” vote on Measure “P” will
maintain the current level of the sales tax and no additional revenues will be
generated to continue or expand on existing public services.
