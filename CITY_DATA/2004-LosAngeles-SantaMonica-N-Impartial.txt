Impartial Analysis by City Attorney

This measure would increase the Cityâ€™s Transient Occupancy Tax from 12% to 14%. The tax is
paid by hotel guests and is computed by multiplying the tax rate times total charges for room
rental.

At present, two separate sections of the Municipal Code each impose a 6% Transient Occupancy
Tax which, when added together, make for a 12% tax. The proposed measure would delete one
of these Code sections and increase the tax rate in the other to allow for a 14% tax.

It is estimated that the proposed tax increase would yield additional general fund revenues of
approximately $3,500,000 annually that could be utilized for a wide variety of public purposes.
The proposed rate of 14% is the same as the current Transient Occupancy Tax rates in the cities
of Los Angeles, West Hollywood and Beverly Hills.
