Impartial Analysis by City Attorney

Chapter 3.12 Section 3.12.020 of the City of Orland Municipal Code currently
imposes an eight- percent (8%) “Hotel Users Tax”, on persons occupying
“Hotels” in the City of Orland. The City Council of the City of Orland is submitting
the following question to the voters at the general municipal election to be held in
the City of Orland on Tuesday, November 7, 2000:

“Shall the ordinance increasing the Hotel Users Tax from
eight percent (8%) to ten percent (10%) be adopted?”

The tax is normally paid to the operator of the hotel at the time payment for the
room rental is made. The hotel operator is required to collect the tax, and the
operator remits the tax to the City of Orland. The estimated amount of money to
be received by the City of Orland’s General Fund for the fiscal year beginning
July 1, 2000, as a result of the current Hotel Users Tax is approximately Forty-
Five Thousand Dollars ($45,000).

As a result of the passage of Proposition 218 by the voters of the State of
California on November 6, 1996, Article XIII C and D of the California
Constitution was amended to include the requirement that “No local government
may impose, extend or increase any general tax unless and until that tax is
submitted to the electorate and approved by a majority vote.” This measure is
therefore submitted to the electorate for their approval or rejection.

A “Yes” vote would approve the adoption by ordinance of a ten percent (10%)
“Hotel Users Tax” and would increase the City’s General Fund revenues by
approximately $11,250.

A “No” vote would reject the measure and would mean that the City’s revenues
from the “Hotel Users Tax” would remain at eight percent (8%).
