This measure seeks voter approval of Ordinance No. 984 which ratifies and
continues the Utility Users Tax enacted by the City Council on July 20, 1992, by
Ordinance No. 820, as amended. Tire current tax rate set by resolution under
Ordinance 820 is 5% on the use of utilities in the City of Pico Rivera. The
utilities upon which the tax is imposed are telephone services, including cellular,
electricity, cable television and gas. The tax does not apply to water usage.

The Ordinance also contains provisions relating to calculation and payment of
the tax, administration of the tax, request for refunds, termination or suspension
of the tax, and an annual review of the tax.

If passed, this measure keeps the current tax rate at 5%. The tax rate can only be
changed by a vote of the people.

This measure also provides an exemption from the tax for low-income persons
eligible to participate in utility discount programs, as well as school districts,
government agencies and water corporations.

During fiscal year 2001-2002, the Utility Users Tax provided approximately $3.06
million of the City’s general fund revenue, or about 17.38% of the City’s general
fund operating budget.

A “yes” vote on this measure would ratify the current Utility Users Tax, as
enacted and subsequently amended, from its date of adoption. In addition, the
current 5% tax rate and aforementioned exemptions would continue in full force
and effect and could not be modified without a vote of the people.

A “no” vote on this measure would require the City to stop collecting the Utility
Users Tax and would result in a $3,060,000 reduction in the City’s general fund
revenue. This reduction in revenue would require the City Council to cut
programs or services, which may include public safety, public works and/or
recreation.
