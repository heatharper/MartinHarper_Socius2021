CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL	

ANALYSIS OF CITY MEASURE R	

Ballot Measure R is a proposal to impose a one
percent transaction and use tax on gross receipts of
retailers within the incorporated territory of the City of
Lakeport for repair, replacement, construction or reconstruction of the City’s streets and road systems and for
an increase in the City’s spending limit so that the
monies collected can be used for such purposes.

The ordinance is adopted pursuant to Revenue
and Taxation Code Section 7286.40 and shall not
become operative unless approved by two-thirds of the
electors voting on the measure on Tuesday, September
19,1995.

If adopted, the operative date shall be the first day
of the first calendar quarter commencing more than 110
days after adoption of the transaction and use tax ordinance.

If adopted, the City shall enter into a contract with
the State Board of Equalization for administration of the
tax collection so as to minimize the cost of collection.

Upon collection, the proceeds shall be deposited
into a special fund for the sole purpose of the repair,
replacement, construction or reconstruction of the City
of Lakeport’s streets and road systems.

The ordinance provides for automatic expiration
ten years from the date on which it receives voter
approval.

Additionally, if adopted, the appropriations limit for
the City would be increased by the amount of the maxi-
mum projected aggregate collection authorized by the
imposition of this tax.
