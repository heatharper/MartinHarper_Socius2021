MEASURE “M”
IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS

A majority “yes” vote would enact Measure “M”.

Measure “M” would increase Hesperia’s transient occupancy tax (“TOT”) from 7% to
10%. The TOT, commonly referred to as a “bed tax” is imposed upon travelers who
spend the night at a Hotel/Motel in the city, and is intended to compensate the city for
the drain on resources that Hotel/Motel occupants create. The Hotel/Motel operator
collects the TOT for the city and remits the amount collected to the city on a regular
basis. The TOT is classified as a “General Tax”. Consequently, under State
Proposition 218, any increase in the TOT must be approved by a majority of the city’s
voters voting at a general election. Revenue derived from the TOT is deposited in the
city’s general fund and may be used for general municipal purposes; such as: Public
Safety Services and other public services, as well as construction and maintenance of
city property, including buildings, streets, parks and other city works of improvement.

Existing Law

The city’s TOT is presently imposed at the rate of 7% of the rent charged by the
Hotel/Motel operator.

Effect Measure “M” on Existing Law

Measure “M”, if approved by a majority of the city’s voters voting at the November 7,
2006 general election, will increase the TOT rate from 7% to 10%. If Measure “M” is
not approved, the TOT will remain at 7%.
