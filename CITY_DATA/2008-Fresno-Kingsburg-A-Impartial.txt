IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY

This measure, if approved by more than 50% of the qualified voters in Kingsburg
casting votes in this election, will enact Ordinance No. 2008-07, revising Section
3.16.030 of Chapter 3.16 of Title 3 of the Kingsburg Municipal Code, the City’s
Transient Occupancy Hotel Tax. Chapter 3.16 currently provides for a Transient
Occupancy Hotel Tax of eight percent (8%).

This measure will increase the Transient Occupancy Hotel Tax rate to twelve percent
(12%). The Transient Occupancy Hotel Tax is NOT assessed on Kingsburg residents
or businesses. Rather, it is assessed on visitors to Kingsburg, who stay in hotels, as
defined in Chapter 3.16, for periods of thirty days or less. Certain exemptions to the
payment of the Transient Occupancy Hotel Tax are provided in Chapter 3.16. Each
hotel subject to Chapter 3.16 must obtain a certificate from the City, which must be
posted in the hotel at all times. Hotel operators must collect the tax from hotel guests
and remit the tax to the City on a quarterly basis. Penalties are assessed for delinquent
payment of the tax, unless an extension for good cause has been obtained. Along with
remitting the tax to the City, the hotel operator must also file a tax return which shows
the amount of tax collected or otherwise due for the related period.

The hotel operator is provided due process rights to appeal the City’s redetermination
of the amount of tax remitted to the City by a hotel operator. The Transient Occupancy
Hotel Tax is a general tax whose proceeds go into the City’s General Fund and whose
uses are not restricted to a particular purpose.

This tax may not be increased or extended without a majority vote of qualified voters of
the City, but the City Council may otherwise amend the ordinance without a popular
vote.
