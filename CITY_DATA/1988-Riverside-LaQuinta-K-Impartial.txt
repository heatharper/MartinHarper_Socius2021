ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF MEASURE K



On November 8,1988. the voters will decide whether the City should
enact Ordinance No. 125 for the increase of Transient Occupancy Tax
from 8% to 9%. The Transient Occupancy Tax is paid only by guests
and visitors of La Quinta for the privilege of occupying lodging facilities
for a period of 30 days or less. It will not increase any tax assessments
paid by the residents of La Quinta. The tax will generate needed
additional revenue to support such services as Code Enforcement and
Public Safety. It is one of the few taxes that you, the residents will
decide on that will not affect your tax bill. We estimate that this
proposal will increase our General Fund in excess of $100,000 per year.
The City Council urges your support of this measure and asks that you
vote yes on Measure K.
