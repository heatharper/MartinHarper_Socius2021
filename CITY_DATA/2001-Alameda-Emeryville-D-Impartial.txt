CITY ATTORNEY IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE D

The purpose of this measure is to adopt an ordinance increasing the existing
tax imposed on transients, defined as persons who exercise occupancy in a hotel
or motel for a period of thirty (30) consecutive calendar days or less in the City
of Emeryville. The increased taxes will be utilized to provide for general municipal services within the City of Emeryville. Under Proposition 218, adopted in
1996, proposed tax and fee increases must be placed on the ballot for voter
approval.

Currently, the tax imposed on transients is ten percent (10%) of the rent
charged by the hotel or motel operator. As an example, if the rent charged by a
hotel or motel operator for a one night stay is $100 per night, the tax charged is
$10. The guest would pay $10 to the hotel or motel operator for the one night
stay, and the operator would then pay to the City of Emeryville the $10 tax it
collected from the guest. Under the proposed ordinance, the tax imposed on
transients would be increased to twelve percent (12%) of the rent charged by the
hotel or motel operator. In the example above, the tax charged would be $12.

A YES vote will increase the tax imposed on transients to twelve percent
(12%) of the rent charged by the hotel or motel operator.

A NO vote will not increase the tax imposed on transients; however, the present tax imposed on transients, which is ten percent (10%) of the rent charged
by the hotel or motel operator, will remain in effect.
