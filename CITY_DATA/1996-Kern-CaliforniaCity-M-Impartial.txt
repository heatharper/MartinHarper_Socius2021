municipal fire suppression and panic hazard service. The assessment for each
unimproved lot or parcel would be $19.00 per year. The assessment for each
improved residential lot or parcel will be $21.09 per year. The assessment for
each improved lot or parcel used for other than residential purposes will be $22.42
per year. The assessments will be used solely to pay for the fire suppression and
panic hazard activities of the California City Fire Department.
