IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
MEASURE G

The City of Farmersville Revenue Measure approves the enactment of a 4.0% utility user tax
("UUT") within the city of Farmersville. The UUT is a new tax upon the use of phone, electric and
natural gas services by residents and businesses within the City. Elderly citizens receiving
supplemental social security benefits would be exempt from the UUT. In addition, the City is
required to undertake an independent annual audit of the UUT.

The Farmersville Revenue Measure limits the amount of the UUT to 4.0%. The City Council can
reduce the rate from time-to-time, but can never increase the rate above 4.0% without approval of the electorate.

The revenues from the UUT are not designated for any specific purpose, and may be used for
general City functions such as animal control, fire services, park maintenance and police
protection. The UUT is expected to generate approximately $223,500 per year to pay for City
services, and would assist the City with replacing general fund revenues lost in previous years
due, in part, to significant State-level funding cuts to local government.

If the Farmersville Revenue Measure is defeated, the City would be forced to maintain services
at the level provided currently. This would include no animal control, minimal park maintenance
and minimal public safety staffing.

A "Yes" vote on the Farmersville Revenue Measure will approve enactment of a 4% UUT within
the City to replace lost general fund revenues. A "No" vote will prevent the enactment of the
UUT.
