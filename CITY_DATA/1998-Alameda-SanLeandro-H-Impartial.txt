CITY ATTORNEYâ€™S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE H

This measure would establish a business license fee to be paid by the dealers
of concealable firearms. The fee would be calculated based on the gross sales of
firearms capable of being concealed upon the person and ammunition for these
firearms. A firearms dealer would be required to pay an annual base fee of $50
when the dealer purchases a business license to sell concealable firearms. The
dealer would also be required to pay a fee consisting of 3% of the gross sales of
the concealable firearms and ammunition. The fee would not apply to sales to
public agencies. The ordinance was originally passed by the City Council, but
it requires a vote of the people to actually go into effect.
