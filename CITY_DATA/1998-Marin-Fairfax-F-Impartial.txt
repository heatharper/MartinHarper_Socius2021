IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY TOWN ATTORNEY
MEASURE F

If approved by a two-thirds (2/3) vote of the electorate, the special tax for paramedic
services, which is administered by a Joint Powers Authority, and was authorized by the
voters in 1983, 1991 and 1994, would continue with a maximum annual levy of $30.00
Oh each living unit arid $30.00 annually per 1,500 square feet of structure on each developed
parcel of non-residential use. Fees for transport to the hospital would be charged to
insurance providers, independent of the tax, without collection being pursued against
uninsured persons. The appropriations limit established for the Town of Fairfax pursuant
to Article XIIIB of the California Constitution would be increased in an amount equal to
the proceeds of the special tax. The special tax and corresponding increase in appropriations
limit expire on June 30, 2003.
