IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE Z

(Prepared by City Attorney)

TO APPROVE ORDINANCE 019-00 C.S. ADOPTED BY THE
STOCKTON CITY COUNCIL ON JUNE 27, 2000, RELATING
TO A ONE PERCENT (1%) INCREASE IN THE CITY OF
STOCKTON'S HOTEL/MOTEL GUEST TAX

Existing law requires that each operator of a hotel, motel,
inn, rooming house, mobile home or similar structure located
in the City of Stockton collect a tax (known as the Hotel/Motel
Guest Tax) from persons who use the same for dwelling,
lodging, or sleeping purposes for 30 days or less. This tax is
currently eight percent (8%) of the rent charged by the
operator and is imposed on the person who occupies the
premises. It is collected- by the operator at the time rent is
due.

Each month the operator is required to report the rents
charged for that month and the amount of tax collected and
remit the tax to the City of Stockton.

This measure would require that the amount of
Hotel/Motel Guest Tax collected by the operator be increased
by one percent (1%) from the current eight percent (8%) to
nine percent (9%).

The average annual revenue derived from the
Hotel/Motel Guest Tax, over the last ten years, has been $1.2
million. It is anticipated that, if passed, a one percent (1%)
increase in the Hotel/Motel Guest Tax will generate
approximately $121,000 per annum in additional City
revenue.
