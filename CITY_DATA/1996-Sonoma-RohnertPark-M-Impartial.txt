CITY ATTORNEYâ€™S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE M

Passage of the Fire Suppression Benefit Assessment will impose a real property
tax assessment in the total amount of $361,000 per year to be used solely for the
purpose of supplementing funds to obtain, furnish, operate and maintain fire
suppression equipment and apparatus and for salaries and benefits of public safety
personnel assigned to fire suppression. Any funds not expended at the end of any
fiscal year would be carried over for the same purposes the next year.

The assessment may be adjusted each year not to exceed the percentage change
in Consumer Price Index for the San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose area, not to
exceed three percent (3%) per year.

The assessment is based on the size and use of the parcel rather than on its dollar
value. If this measure is passed, the initial annual assessment for a single-family
residence will be $22.94; a condominium unit will be assessed $17.20; a 10-unit
apartment complex will be assessed $160.16; a mobilehome will be assessed
$15.26; a one-half acre improved commercial/industrial parcel will be assessed
$147.72; and a 10-acre commercial/industrial parcel will be assessed $960.18.
