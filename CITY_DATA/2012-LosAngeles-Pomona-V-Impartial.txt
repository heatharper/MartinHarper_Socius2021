IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE V

Transient Occupancy Tax-Amendment to PCC section 50-82

The City of Pomona currently imposes a Transient Occupancy Tax, commonly
known as a “Hotel Tax” or “TOT,” in the amount of ten percent (10%) of the
rent charged by the hotel operator. The tax is only imposed on each “transient”
or hotel guest who stays at hotels within the city limits of Pomona. (Pomona City
Code § 50-82). The tax revenues are collected by the hotels from their guests and
then paid to the City.

The TOT was established by the City in 1965, and the current rate of ten percent
(10%) has remained unchanged for the last 18 years (since 1994). The tax is not
paid by property owners within the City. The TOT is only paid by hotel
customers.

If adopted, Measure “V” will amend section 50-82 of the Pomona City Code to
increase the TOT rate to twelve percent (12%) of the rent charged by the
operator. If adopted by the voters, it is estimated that the increase will result in
an additional $288,000.00 in general funds annually, although the actual results
may vary depending on the health of the economy. All additional revenue
received from the TOT will be deposited into the City’s general fund, to be
expended on general fund purposes, such as police services, fire protection,
street maintenance, business development and park and recreation services. If
adopted, the TOT rate of twelve percent (12%) would take effect upon the
earliest date legally possible after the City Clerk certifies the votes.

A “Yes” vote on Measure “V” supports the increase of the TOT rate from ten
percent (10%) to twelve percent (12%) of the rent charged by the hotel operator.
A “No” vote on Measure “V” will maintain the current TOT rate.
