IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE F

Since 1970, the City of Redwood City has collected a transient occupancy
tax from hotel patrons or transients (those persons occupying hotel rooms
for a period of less than 30 days). Since 1978, the transient occupancy tax
has been imposed at a rate of 8% of the rent charged for the room. The
transient pays the tax to the hotel operator who in turn sends the tax to the
City of Redwood City. The City then deposits the transient occupancy tax
into its General Fund to support various City services including public
safety. If a majority vote approves this measure, the transient occupancy
tax will increase to a new rate of 10%.
