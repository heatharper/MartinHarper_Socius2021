CITY ATTORNEYâ€™S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS
MEASURE D

This proposed measure, if adopted by a two-thirds vote of the voters
voting on the measure, would impose a special tax on the parcels of property
in our City based upon zoning classification use or size of the property. Said
tax would be for the specific purpose of funding police and fire protection
services. The proceeds therefrom would be placed in a special fund and the
use of the monies would be restricted to police and fire protection services
only. The tax will continue until repealed or modified by the voters or until five
years from the adoption of this ordinance, whichever occurs first. The City
Council is unable to increase the taxes charged above the maximum set by
this measure, but will be authorized to reduce or suspend the taxes if they find
and determine they are unnecessary.

The expenditure limitations imposed by article XIIIB of the California
Constitution will be increased in the amount collected from the tax so that the
additional funds may be used for their restricted purposes.
