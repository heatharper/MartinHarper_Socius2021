IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE I

The City Council of the City of La Mirada has placed Measure I on the ballot to
ask the voters whether or not to approve an ordinance that would enact a
temporary one percent (1%) transactions and use tax within the City. This would
be a general tax and the proceeds may be used for any municipal purpose
including addressing the City’s current declared fiscal emergency by maintaining
current levels of municipal services in spite of financial shortfalls due to
economic conditions. This measure will automatically terminate after five (5)
years. The measure requires appointment of a Citizens Oversight Committee to
review and report on the revenue and expenditure of the tax proceeds. Annual
independent audits must be conducted to account for the tax revenues received
and expenditures made, and those audits will be provided to the Citizens
Oversight Committee for review.

There is currently a one percent (1%) local sales and use tax which is levied on
the sale or use of tangible personal property, collected at the time of transaction,
and remitted to the State Board of Equalization for administration. The current
total tax on retail sales in La Mirada is 8.75 percent (8.75%). If this measure is
adopted, the total sales tax rate will increase to 9.75 percent (9.75%).

Exemptions and exclusions from application of the proposed tax include the
amount of any sales or use tax imposed by the State or county, as well as various
other exemptions specified in the Revenue and Taxation Code.

A “Yes” vote is a vote to approve the enactment of an ordinance establishing the
one percent (1%) transactions and use tax rate, with annual audits and Citizens
Oversight Committee review, subject to specified exemptions. A “No” vote is a
vote against the ordinance. This measure will be approved if it receives a simple
majority of “Yes” votes.
