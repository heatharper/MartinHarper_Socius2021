IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE P

Measure P is not a new tax. The City passed the current utility users tax in 1991.
Measure P was placed on the ballot as a result of recent court rulings indicating
that the current utility users tax should have been passed by the voters consistent
with Proposition 62. As such. Measure P must be approved by at least a majority
of the voters on November 2, 2004, in order to ratify the tax.

The City’s budgeted financial statement shows that the Utility Users Tax will
generate approximately $600,000.00 this fiscal year. The tax is one of the City’s
largest revenue sources and amounts to 13% of the total general fund budget.
The general fund pays for public services such as police protection, parks and
recreation, and certain public works projects.

If approved by a majority of voters. Measure P would confirm and ratify the
current 4% residential tax rate and increase the business tax rate to 8%. Eligible
senior citizens would continue to be exempt from the tax. Measure P would
prohibit any future tax increase without a vote of the people.

If Measure P is defeated at the polls, the City would be forced to cut
approximately one million dollars from its yearly general operating fund. Such a
cut would significantly affect the City's ability to provide needed public services,
such as police protection, public parks, recreational youth programs, senior
citizen programs, and street repairs.

A “YES” vote on Measure P means that you want the Utility Users Tax to
continue to be collected and fund certain city services and programs.

A “NO” vote means that you do not want the Utility Users Tax to be collected
after November 4, 2004 and that the City must cut back on certain city services
and programs.
