IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE U
Prepared by City Attorney

This ballot measure requests that the voters approve an
increase in the City’s Hotel-Motel Occupancy Tax. This tax is
paid by those persons who occupy a hotel or motel room for a
period of less than 30 days. The current rate of collection for
this tax is 9%. The new rate of collection, if approved, would
be 10%. The current rate of collection has been in place
since 1991. It generates approximately $429,756.00 
revenue per year. At the 10% rate, approximately $47,756.00
of additional annual revenue would be collected. The money
collected from this tax is placed in the City’s General Fund.
Money from the General Fund is used to provide overall
services in the following approximate percentages; Public
Safety (Police and Fire) 42%; General Government 27%;
Leisure, Cultural and Social Services 13%; Community and
Economic Development 11%; and Transportation 7%. Since
this tax is a general tax, the vote needed to approve the
increase is a simple majority (50% +1) of those voting on the
measure.
