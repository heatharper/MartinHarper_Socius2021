
CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE H

This Ordinance, if adopted, would amend the “Library Relief Act of 1980,” Ordinance No. 5262-
N.S,, which was adopted by the voters in 1980, and which imposed a City-wide, ten year special tax
to fund library operations. In amending Ordinance No. 5262-N.S., this Ordinance would increase,
and make permanent, the City-wide special tax on all residential and commercial buildings and units.
This Ordinance would also increase the City’s constitutional appropriations limit, under Article XIIIB
of the California Constitution, in an amount equal to the aggregate sum raised by this special tax for
each of the four fiscal years from 1988-1989 through 1991-92. It is estimated that this special tax will
provide revenues necessary to finance the operation of the City’s library services at a level which
permits (1) the City’s central library to operate seven days per week; (2) the City’s Branch libraries to
operate six days per week; and (3) purchases of library books and materials to be increased to
correspond with the libraries’ hours of operation, service and staffing. The Ordinance allows the City
Council to increase the annual tax rate in subsequent fiscal years consistent with any annual increases
in the greater of either the cost of living which may occur in the San Francisco Bay area, or personal
income growth in California. The Ordinance also creates an exemption from the tax for those owners
of property whose total personal income does not exceed that level which constitutes “very low-income.” Under the Ordinance, the level which constitutes “very low-income” would be established
by resolution of the City Council for each year, except for fiscal year 1988-89 in which the level which
constitutes “very low-income” is defined as below $7,000. To qualify for the exemption, taxpayers
would be required to provide documentation of their income.

The tax is based upon the square footage of taxable improvements. Under this Ordinance, the tax
on residential units would increase from 3.4 cents per square foot to 7.2 cents per square foot, and
the tax on commercial and industrial units would increase from 5.1 cents per square foot to 10.9 cents
per square foot. The tax would raise an estimated additional revenue of $1,300,000 during fiscal year
1988-89 and approximately $6,071,000 total revenue in 1989-90. The old Library tax rate raised
approximately $3,000,000 annually.

It is estimated that the tax will cost taxpayers the following average amounts during fiscal year
1988-89:

RESIDENTIAL UNITS	COMMERCIAL/INDUSTRIAL	UNITS

(7.2 Cents / sq. ft.)	(10.9	Cents / sq.	ft.)

Square Feet	Annual Tax	Square Feet	Annual Tax
500	36	1,000	109
1,000	72	3,000	327
1,500	108	5,000	545
2,000	144	10,000	1090
2,500	180	20,000	2180
3,000	216	30,000	3270
4,000	288		
5,000	360		

Financial Implications

The special tax would be increased to 7.2 cents per square foot for residential units and 10.9 cents
per square foot for commercial units. Increased revenues of $1,300,000 during the fiscal year 1988-
89, future annual revenue increase of approximately $3,000,000, depending on changes in income
growth or inflation.
