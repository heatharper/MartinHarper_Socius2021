CITY OF OJAI
IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS
LIBRARY SPECIAL TAX ORDINANCE
MEASURE "R"

If approved, this ordinance will authorize a special tax for support and
maintenance of the Library.

The purpose of the ordinance is to levy a special tax on each
residential dwelling unit or non-residential parcel within the City of Ojai to
pay for maintenance and operating costs of the Library, and for
administrative expenses limited to implementation of the ordinance,
including refunds involved in the collection of this special tax. The tax is
imposed annually, unless the City Council determines by June 30 before the
next fiscal year not to impose the tax for that fiscal year.

The ordinance calculates approximately One Hundred Thousand
Dollars ($100,000.00) as the amount budgeted to be received from the
special tax each fiscal year. This amount is to be used to restore the Library
to its 1992-1993 level of full-time service.

The tax rate cannot exceed the maximum established by the ordinance
without the approval of a two-thirds vote of the electors of the City of Ojai.
