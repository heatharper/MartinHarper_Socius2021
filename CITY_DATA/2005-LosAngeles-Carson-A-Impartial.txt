Ballot Measure A proposes the adoption of an ordinance that proponents
contend would more appropriately title the City of Carson’s existing transient
occupancy tax (or “TOT”) as a “hotel visitor’s tax,” and increase the rate of
that tax from 9% to 12%.

Under existing state law, cities such as Carson are permitted to collect a
tax from hotel and motel guests and other temporary lodgers in the City.
The hotel visitor’s tax currently being collected by the City from temporary
lodgers is at the rate of 9% of the hotel or motel room charge. The changes
proposed by Measure A would title the TOT as the “Uniform Hotel Visitor’s
Tax,” and would increase the rate of that tax from 9% to 12%. Any further
change in this hotel visitor’s tax rate would require voter approval. This
tax does not apply to persons renting apartments, houses, mobilehome
spaces, or other dwellings for periods of time longer than thirty (30) days.

Measure A does not propose any new tax or fee; rather it proposes a 3%
increase to an existing tax. A “Yes” vote on Measure A means you favor
changing the title of the City’s TOT to the “Uniform Hotel Visitor’s Tax,”
and that you also favor increasing the tax rate for hotel and motel guests,
and other temporary lodgers, from 9% to 12%. A “No” vote on Measure A
means you favor maintaining the existing name for this tax and maintaining
the existing tax rate. The measure will be adopted if it is approved by a
majority of the voters.
