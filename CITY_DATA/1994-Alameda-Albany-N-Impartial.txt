CITY ATTORNEYâ€™S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE N

The Albany Library is a County library. This Measure provides a mechanism for
Albany to raise revenues to supplement funding from Alameda County in an effort to
assist in maintaining library services at a level prior to funding cuts due to state and
county budgetary constraints. Alameda County Board of Supervisors has been cutting
funds to its libraries throughout the County. The City of Albany may enact its own tax
in an effort to maintain library services. If this Measure passes, the City of Albany would
then negotiate with Alameda County for expansion of library services.

This measure requires approval of two-thirds of the voters of the City of Albany.
Obviously, this Measure will result in an increase of tax dollars paid by the citizens of
the City of Albany. The single family homeowner and condominium owner will pay $42
per year. Apartment owners will pay $31.50 per unit.
