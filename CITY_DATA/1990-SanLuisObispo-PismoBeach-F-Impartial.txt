IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
MEASURE F
CITY OF PISMO BEACH
INCREASE IN TRANSIENT OCCUPANCY TAX

State law authorizes general law cities to “levy a tax on the privilege of
occupying a room in a hotel, inn, tourist home or house, motel, or other
lodging” (including RV parks). The tax is known generally as a "transient
occupancy tax" (also, "bed tax”). The person renting the lodging pays the
tax at the time payment is made for the lodging. The tax is calculated on the
basis of a percentage rate charged against the total cost of the room or
lodging.

Ordinance No. 0-90-11 proposes to increase the City's transient occupancy
tax from the current percentage rate charge of 7% to an increased percentage
rate of 9%, effective January 1,1991.

The increased tax revenue is estimated to be approximately $550,000.00
annually.

As a tax increase to be included in the City’s general fund, the ordinance
must be approved by a majority of the voters voting on the proposition to
approve or deny the tax increase.

A YES vote is a vote for the proposition to increase the transient occupancy
tax.

A NO vote is a vote against the proposition to increase the transient
occupancy tax.
