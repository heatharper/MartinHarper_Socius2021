Impartial Analysis of measure “O”

Measure "0" proposes the ratification by voters in Palm Desert of
Ordinance No. 679 by passage of Ordinance No. 1071. Ordinance No.
679 passed in 1992, established the rate for Transient Occupancy Tax
(hotel bed tax) at nine percent (9%). The law, at the time of passage of
Ordinance No. 679, did not require voter approval of such rate increase.
Courts since that time have determined that voter approval should be
required. Ordinance No. 1071, if ratified by the voters, would satisfy such
approval requirement.

A vote of "Yes” will ratify and approve the current rate of nine percent
(9%) tor the Transient Occupancy Tax in the City of Palm Desert. A vote
of "No" will invalidate the rate of nine percent (9%) and revert to the
earlier rate prior to 1992 of eight percent (8%).
