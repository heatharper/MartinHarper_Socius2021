IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
MEASURE K

City of Monterey General Purpose Transactions and Use Tax

This ballot measure, if adopted by the voters, would enact a temporary
one-quarter of one percent (1/4%) increase in the transactions and use
tax rate within the City of Monterey. The “transactions and use tax" referred
to by the ballot measure is more commonly referred to as "sales tax."
The increase in sales tax imposed by this measure would expire in five
(5) years.

The current sales tax rate in the City of Monterey is seven and one-
quarter percent (7 1/4%). Accordingly, this ballot measure would increase
the sales tax rate to seven and one-half percent (7 1/2%) for the next five
years. The proposed increased sales tax, like the current sales tax, would
be imposed upon the sale of all tangible personal property sold at retail
within the jurisdictional limits of the City, as well as upon the storage,
use, or other consumption of tangible personal property purchased from
any retailer within the jurisdictional limits of the City of Monterey.

All revenue generated from the proposed sales tax increase would
be deposited into the City’s General Fund and, accordingly, all monies
collected pursuant to the sales tax increase would be used by the City
to pay for general City operations and services. As such, this ballot measure
proposes a "general purpose tax” and requires a simple majority vote for
adoption.
