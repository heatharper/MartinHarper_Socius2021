The Council of the Town of Portola Valley has called for a municipal
election to be combined with the general election to be held on
November 8, 2005, for the purposes of presenting to the Town's qualified
electors a ballot measure, which if approved by more than 50% of the
voters voting on the measure, and if Ballot Measure H authorizing an
adjustment in the Town’s appropriations limit is approved, will authorize
an additional adjustment in the Town’s appropriations limit for each of the
next four fiscal years starting on July 1, 2006, by the amount of money
raised from the imposition of the current 2% utility user’s tax to fund
open-space projects during the time of its levy and collection. Following
the final fiscal year of these four fiscal years, the Town's appropriations
limit will revert to the amount it would have been had this ballot measure
not received a favorable vote.

If the measure receives a favorable vote and if Ballot Measure H is
approved, the special utility user’s tax will continue to be levied and
collected at a rate not to exceed 2%. Money collected from this tax levy
will be placed in a special Town account to fund open-space projects
selected by the Town. If the measure does not receive a favorable vote
and/or Measure H does not receive a favorable vote, the special utility
user’s tax may not be levied, collected and expended in an amount that
would cause the Town to exceed its current appropriations limit.
