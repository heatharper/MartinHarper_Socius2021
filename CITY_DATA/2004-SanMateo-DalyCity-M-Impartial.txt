IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE M

The Daly City City Council has placed this matter on the ballot for voter
determination. This ballot measure, if adopted by the voters, would enact
Daly City Ordinance 1309 raising revenue for the City of Daly City by
authorizing a one-quarter of one cent (1/40) local sales tax within Daly
City. The sales tax is also referred to as a “transactions and use tax.” The
proposed sales tax would be imposed upon the sale of all tangible personal
property sold at retail within jurisdictional limits of Daly City as well as
upon the storage, use or other consumption of tangible personal property
purchased from any retailer in the jurisdictional limits of Daly City. Those
items exempt from existing sales tax would similarly be exempt from this
proposed sales tax.

Under the proposed measure the tax revenue would be put into the City’s
general fund for general City government purposes. General fund money
pays for a wide variety of basic City services including public safety, parks,
libraries, building repairs and road maintenance.

A majority vote of the City’s voters voting in this election is required to
approve this measure. The tax could not be increased in the future except
by another vote of the City’s voters.

A “yes” vote on Measure M is a vote in favor of approving Ordinance 1309.
A “no” vote on Measure M is a vote against approving the Ordinance.
