MEASURE O
IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS

Measure O proposes to raise revenue to fund the Needles Municipal Hospital by
authorizing a one-half of one percent (0.50%) increase to the existing retail sales tax within the
City of Needles. The tax would be paid in addition to current State and local sales taxes and
would be collected at the same time and in the same manner as the existing sales taxes. As a
special tax, Measure O must receive a two-thirds majority vote to pass.

If Measure O is approved, all funds collected pursuant to the Measure will be used to
support the Needles Municipal Hospital. The State Board of Equalization shall administer all
funds collected through Measure O. Measure O shall remain in effect for a period of five (5)
years, beginning at the commencement of collection of this tax by the State Board of Equalization
and then shall automatically terminate unless terminated in writing by the City Council prior to the
expiration of the five (5) year period.

At its February 26, 2008 regular meeting, the City Council of the City of Needles
adopted an ordinance proposing Measure O and a resolution submitting the Measure to a vote of
the electors of the City. A “Yes” vote by a two-thirds majority of voters on Measure O is a vote to
approve and allow the City to supplement the current retail sales tax by one-half of one percent
(0.50%). A “No” vote on Measure O would maintain the sales tax at its current rate.
