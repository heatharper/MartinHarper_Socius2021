TOWN COUNSEL’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE N

The Town of Windsor currently has in place an ordinance that requires any person
who occupies a hotel within the Town limits for 30 consecutive days or less to pay
to the operator of the hotel a transient occupancy tax in the amount of 8% of the
rent charged. Each hotel operator then transfers to the Town the amount collected
for such occupancies. Monies received by the Town in this regard are placed in the
Town’s General Fund and are used to help defray expenses and costs of services
provided by the Town. This tax is levied only on persons who stay in hotels in the
Town for 30 consecutive days or less.

Measure N proposes to amend the Town’s current ordinance to increase the rate of
the tax paid by said occupants of hotels from 8% to 12% of the rent charged by the
hotel operator. A yes vote on Measure N would amend the current ordinance and
allow this increase. A no vote would retain the current ordinance.

This amendment to the Town’s Ordinance shall not become effective until approved
by a majority of the voters voting on the issue at the November 4,2008 election.
