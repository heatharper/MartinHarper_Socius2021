MEASURE “G”

CITY OF ADELANTO

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY

Proposition 218, now California Constitution Article XIII C requires voter approval for all
local taxes effective November 6, 1996.

The City of Adelanto has previously established rates for business license fees. However
any general tax imposed, extended or increased without voter approval, by any local
government on or after January 1, 1995 shall continue to be imposed only if approved by
a majority of the voters voting in an election on the issue of the imposition, which election
shall be held within two years of the effective date of this article. The business license fees
imposed by the City of Adelanto are fairly typical of other business license fees imposed by
local governments. If you are in favor of the business license fees vote “yes”; if you are
opposed, vote “no”.
