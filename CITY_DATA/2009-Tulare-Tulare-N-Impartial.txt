IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
MEASURE N

The City of Tulare imposes a 7% Utility Users' Tax on individuals and businesses within
the City who receive electricity, natural gas, water and communications/video services.
This Measure will reduce the maximum tax rate to 6%.

The current Ordinance sets a maximum tax payment per utility of $560 per year. Thus
anyone who has a single utility bill, such as electricity, of more than $8,000 per year is
eligible to apply to pay the maximum tax. This maximum tax provision affects a small
number of non-residential large utility users in the City and results in a substantially
lower tax rate for such customers. As more non-residential large utility users elect to pay
the maximum tax, the revenues to the City may decline. To achieve tax equity between
both residential and non-residential utility users the City Council is seeking voter
approval to eliminate this maximum tax.

Additionally, the City Council is seeking voter approval to add language to the Ordinance
to provide the Council the authority and flexibility to annually review and reduce the 6%
tax rate and/or provide other tax relief, such as establishing a maximum tax amount for
large utility users, to be established by Resolution for the ensuing fiscal year.

Under the existing Utility Users’ Tax rates, the City receives approximately $5.3
million/year which represents approximately 13% of the City's total annual revenues.

The overall fiscal impact of this Measure is unknown. However, the City Council has
stated that the proposed changes to the Utility Users’ Tax rates are intended to lower the
tax rate charged to customers while maintaining the annual revenues received from such
taxes.

The proposed Ordinance also makes a few technical, non-substantive changes to the
language of the Ordinance.

The Measure must be approved by a majority of the voters voting at this election.
