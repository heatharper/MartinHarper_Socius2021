CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS

Ballot Proposition “B” proposes to raise revenue for general purposes for the City of
National City by authorizing a one percent transaction and use tax (commonly referred
to as a "sales tax") within the City of National City. The one cent tax would be paid in
addition to current sales taxes and would be collected at the same time and in the
same manner as existing sales taxes.

California Revenue and Taxation Code Section 7285.9 authorizes the City Council to
levy a transaction and use tax at a rate of 0.25 percent or a multiple thereof, provided
the tax is approved by a majority of the voters voting in an election on that issue. If
approved, the tax would go into effect April 1,2006.

Proposition “B” states that the one percent sales tax is to be used "for City services,
facilities and programs.” Because this sales tax would be a "general tax ” the tax would
go into the City's general fund and could be used for any legal municipal purpose. The
City would not be legally bound in any way to use the tax monies for any special
purpose or for any particular services, facilities or programs.

Proposition "B” provides that every five years the Mayor, with the approval of the City
Council, shall appoint an independent committee comprised of three experts in
financial matters, who will report back their recommendation to the Mayor and City
Council as to whether the transaction and use tax should remain in effect, or be placed
on the ballot to be repealed by a majority of the voters voting thereon.
