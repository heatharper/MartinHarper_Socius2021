CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE F

Under Article of the California Constitution, general law cities, such as the
City of Azusa, are authorized to impose new or increase existing general taxes, if a proposed new levy or increase is approved by a majority of the voters.

The passage of Measure F by a majority of voters in the City would enact
Ordinance No. 97-010. This ordinance authorizes the City to:

-	Increase the swap meet vendors admissions tax from Two Dollars ($2.00) to

Five Dollars ($5.00);	

-	Increase the swap meet attendees admissions tax from Twenty-Five Cents

(.25 c) to Fifty Cents (.50 c); and

-	Establish a gross revenues business license tax on swap meet operators who »
currently only pay One Hundred Twenty-Five Dollar ($125.00) annual business
license tax.

The revenue from the increases and the various swap meet-related taxes will
generate approximately $124,000. This measure increases existing taxes and does
not establish new taxes. The proceeds from these taxes will go into the City’s
General Fund to replace revenues lost due to the impacts of Proposition 218. The
general tax revenue can be used to finance all types of general municipal services,
including, but not limited to, parks and recreation, library, senior citizen program,
building, planning, public works and emergency and safety services.

If approved, the measure will add the necessary authorizing provisions to the
Azusa Municipal Code. In the future, the tax rates can only be changed or if increased by a majority vote of the voters. However, the measure will authorize
the City Council to implement any necessary procedures for collection of the
taxes.

A “yes” vote on the Measure is a vote to approve and authorize the City to increase the various swap meet-related taxes. A “no” vote is a vote against increases in the swap meet-related taxes.
