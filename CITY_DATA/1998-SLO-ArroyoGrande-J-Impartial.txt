Measure J 98 asks voters to decide if the City of Arroyo Grande should
continue to collect a Utility Users Tax. The Utility Users Tax is a tax
charged to people using gas, electricity, water, sewer, telephone and
cable television service. The tax rate is currently 2.4%. City of Arroyo
Grande Ordinance No. 468, which established and regulates the Utility
Users Tax, contains a formula that reduces the tax rate if revenue from
this tax increases or if net revenue from other sources increases. Under
the tax rate reduction formula the tax rate has decreased from 5% in
1995 to the current rate of 2.4%. The tax rate cannot increase. The tax
rate reduction formula remains in place if Measure J 98 is approved by
the majority of voters voting. It is estimated that the Utility Users Tax
will provide the City with approximately $520,000 in revenue for fiscal
year 1998-99 if approved by the electorate. The revenue from this tax
is deposited into the City's general fund. For the past three years City
Council policy requires that revenue from this tax be used for street,
sewer, water and other capital improvement projects, and for acquisition
of capital assets such as police patrol cars and fire fighting response
equipment.
