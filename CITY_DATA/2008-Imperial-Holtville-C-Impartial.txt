
IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
HOLTVILLE UTILITY USERS TAX
MEASURE C

The City of Holtville’s Utility Users Tax was adopted by the City
Council in 1991 (Ordinance No. 415) and amended in 1993 (Ordinance
No. 422). The Utility Users Tax is a general tax devoted for general
governmental purposes including police, fire, emergency services,
administration, and parks and recreation. The Utility Users Tax is a
five percent (5%) tax on users of utilities such as defined telephone
communication services, electrical energy, gas, cable television
service, water, sewers, and garbage collection and removal. For the
fiscal year 2008-2009, anticipated general fund revenue from the tax
will approximate $527,493, almost 18 percent (18%) of the general
fund budget.

Holtville City Council has adopted resolutions to place the question
of increasing the Utility Users Tax on the November 2008 ballot. The
issue before the voters is whether or not to increase the current tax
from five percent (5%) to nine percent (9%). If approved, the four
percent (4%) increase in the Utility Users Tax must be used to fund
improvements in the Holtville Police Department, including
administration, personnel, and capital equipment. The four percent
(4%) increase could not be used for any purpose other than preserving
and maintaining Holtville’s Police Department. The tax rate cannot be
increased without approval of two-thirds or 66.66% of the voters.

Voter approval of Measure C will mean that Holtville Utility Users
Tax will increase from five percent (5%) to nine percent (9%)
commencing in January, 2009. Failure of Measure C to obtain passage
by the requisite margin will mean that the Utility Users Tax will remain
in place at the rate of five percent (5%), and additional revenues will
not be available from the Utility Users Tax to preserve and maintain
improvements within the Holtville Police Department.
