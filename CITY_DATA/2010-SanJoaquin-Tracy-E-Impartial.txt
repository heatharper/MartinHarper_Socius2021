IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE E
Prepared by Tracy City Attorney

ONE-HALF CENT TRANSACTIONS AND USE (SALES) TAX

The Tracy City Council has placed Measure E on the ballot to
ask the voters of Tracy if the City should enact a one-half cent
sales tax for five years. The sales tax is also referred to as a.
transactions and use tax. If approved by a majority of the
voters, the one-half cent sales tax would become operative on
April 1, 2011. The proposed increased City of Tracy sales tax
would be collected at the same time and in the same manner
as existing sales taxes.

If Measure E is approved, the proposed increased sales tax
will expire five years after it starts being collected.

This one-half cent sales tax would be a general tax, meaning
that the revenue raised from the tax would go into the City's
general fund and could be used for any municipal
governmental purpose. Municipal governmental purposes
include: police (patrol, 911, command, gang and narcotics
enforcement, crime investigations, other police services); fire
protection, emergency services, and other fire services; park
and sports field maintenance; support services; senior, teen,
and youth services; art programs; and other general functions
and services.

If Measure E is approved, the City’s independent auditors will
be required to complete a financial audit report, by no later
than December 31st of each year, which will include the
revenue raised and expended by this tax. Also, if Measure E
is approved, the Tracy City Council will establish a Residents’
Oversight Committee to review the expenditure of the revenue
from this tax prior to any collection of the tax. The Committee
will consist of five members to be appointed by the Mayor and
approved by the City Council. The terms of the Committee
members and their specific duties will be established by
resolution of the City Council.
