

CITY ATTORNEY'S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE L

This ordinance would authorize a special tax of 1.30 per square foot of improvements on land in Berkeley to pay for enhanced and innovative pedestrian safety improvements, such as traffic circles, access upgrades at traffic signals for
people with disabilities, lighted pedestrian crosswalks and other improvements
that increase pedestrian safety in residential neighborhoods and commercial and
industrial areas. The funds would be utilized to address dangerous intersections
throughout the City. The tax will automatically expire in 2013. The tax rate
imposed by this measure may be adjusted by the Council by the increase in the
cost of living in the immediate San Francisco Bay Area, or personal income
growth in the state of California, whichever is greater. The City Council may
repeal this ordinance, or amend it in a manner that does not result in an increase
in the tax imposed herein, without further voter approval.

Financial Implications

The proposed City special tax rate would limit the annual cost for an average

1,900	square foot home to $24.70 in fiscal year 2003-04. This level of funding
is not currently available for pedestrian safety related improvements.

It is estimated that the tax will cost residential taxpayers no more than the following average amounts during FY 2003-04:

Square Feet	Annual Tax

1,200	$ 15.60

1,500	$ 19.50

1,900	$ 24.70

3,000	$ 39.00

10,000	$130.00
