IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
MEASURE C

City of Scotts Valley
Temporary Transactions and Use Tax

Temporary (Five Year) Sales Tax Increase of One-Half Percent For 3 years and
then Reduced to One-Quarter Percent for 2 Years

This ballot measure, if adopted by the voters, would enact a temporary sales tax
measure for a total of five years. For the first three years, the tax increase would be
one-half of one percent (1/2%). For the final two years, the tax would be reduced to
one-quarter of one percent (%%). The sales tax is also referred to as a “transactions and use tax.” The current sales tax rate in the City of Scotts Valley is eight
percent. Accordingly, if the ballot measure is adopted, the sales tax rate would increase to eight and one-half percent for three years after the adoption of the ballot
measure. It would then be reduced to eight and one-quarter percent for the final
two years of the tax measure. The proposed sales tax, like the current sales tax,
would be imposed upon the sale of all tangible personal property sold at retail establishments within the jurisdictional limits of the City as well as upon the storage,
use or other consumption of tangible personal property purchased from any retailer
in the jurisdictional limits of the City.

All revenue generated from the proposed sales tax increase would be deposited
into the City’s General Fund and, accordingly, all monies collected pursuant to the
sales tax increase would be used by the City to pay for general City operations and
services, including, police, parks and street maintenance. As such, this ballot measure proposes a “general purpose tax” rather than a “special purpose tax” and requires a simple majority vote for adoption.
