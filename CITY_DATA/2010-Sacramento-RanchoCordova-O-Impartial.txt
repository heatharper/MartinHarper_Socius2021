
IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE O

Prepared by Rancho Cordova City Attorney

The Rancho Cordova City Council has placed Measure O on the
November 2, 2010 general municipal election ballot which asks
voters to adopt an ordinance that would amend Rancho
Cordova’s Municipal Code to add a new Chapter 3.85 entitled
"Personal Cannabis Cultivation Tax.”

If approved by a majority of voters at the November 2, 2010 election, Measure 6 would establish a new excise tax on the privilege
of lawful cultivation of marijuana for personal use within the City
of Rancho Cordova. Measure O would impose a tax on cultivation
as follows:

For indoor cultivation:

a.	If the cultivated area is equal to or less than 25 square feet,
$600 per year for each square foot of cultivated area, or

b.	If the cultivated area is over 25 square feet, $900 per year for
each square foot of cultivated area.

For example: A residence where the cultivated area indoors is
10.5 square feet shall pay $6,300 annually ($600 per sq. foot X 10.5
sq. feet). A residence where the cultivated area indoors is 30
square feet shall pay $27,000 annually ($900 per sq. foot X 30 sq.
feet).

For outdoor cultivation:

a.	If the cultivated area is equal to or less than 25 square feet,
$600 per year for each 12.5 square feet of cultivated area, or

b.	If the cultivated area is over 25 square feet, $900 per year for
each 12.5 square feet of cultivated area.

For example: A residence where the cultivated area outdoors is
25 square feet, shall pay $1,200 annually ((25 sq. feet per 12.5 sq.
feet) = 2 X $600 per 12.5 sq., feet). A residence where the total cultivated area outdoors is 30 square feet shall pay $2,160 annually
((30 sq. feet per 12.5 sq. feet) = 2.4 X $900 per 12.5 sq. feet).

If a property has cultivated area both indoors and outdoors,
Measure O would require the cannabis grower to pay the sum of
the indoor and outdoor taxes.

Before engaging in cannabis cultivation, Measure O would require
all cannabis growers to register with the City by completing and filing an application form for Personal Cannabis Cultivation with the
City’s Finance Department.

The proposed Personal Cannabis Cultivation Tax is a general tax,
and therefore the revenues from the tax are placed, in the City’s
general fund for the usual expenses of the City, and then may be
used for general governmental purposes, such as providing code
enforcement and police services. Pursuant to Article (C),
Section 2 (b) of the California Constitution, in order for the
Personal Cannabis Cultivation Tax to be approved, the electorate
must adopt Measure O by a majority vote.

A “yes” vote is a vote to adopt the Personal Cannabis Cultivation
Tax.

A “no” vote is a vote against adopting the Personal Cannabis
Cultivation Tax.
