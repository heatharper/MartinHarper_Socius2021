CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS
OF MEASURE Z

Measure Z would authorize a one-half of one percent
(0.50%) supplementation to the existing retail sales and
use tax within the City of Clearlake. The tax would be
paid in addition to current state and local retail sales and
use taxes and would be collected at the same time and in
the same manner as the existing retail sales and use taxes.

All funds collected through Measure Z would be
administered by the State Board of Equalization. Measure
Z would remain in effect for a period of twenty (20) years,
beginning at the commencement of collection of this tax
by the State Board of Equalization and thereafter automatically terminating unless earlier repealed by the City
Council.

If approved, Measure Z would create a Citizens
Oversight Committee. The Citizens Oversight Committee
would be responsible for reviewing expenditures of funds
collected through Measure Z, recommending public programs or projects in need of such funds, and issuing
annual public reports on their findings.

The City Council of the City of Clearlake adopted a
resolution on August 10, 2006, calling this election and
submitting this Measure to a vote of the electors of the
City. A “Yes” vote by a majority voting on Measure Z is a
vote to approve and allow the City to supplement the current retail sales and use tax by one-half of one percent
(0.50%). A “No” vote on Measure Z would maintain the
retail sales and use tax at its current rate of seven and
three quarters percent (7.75%).
