A “Yes” vote on Measure E will extend measure T’s one percent (1 %) transactions and use tax generally known as a sales tax, for five
years. Measure T is codified as Hollister Municipal Code Chapter 3.30.

Measure T was approved in 2007 by the voters of the City of Hollister to be in effect for five (5) years, from April 1, 2008, until March 31,
2013, when Measure I will automatically expire. When Measure T expires, revenue to the City of Hollister will be reduced by approximately three
million dollars ($3,000,000) per year.

Measure E amends two sections of Hollister Municipal Code Chapter 3.30. Those two changes are the start date for the tax which is April
1,2013, and the end date for the tax which is March 31; 2018. Other than its effective dates, Measure E is identical to Measure T.

Consistent with current Hollister Municipal Code Chapter 3.30, Measure E’s transaction and use tax will continue to be collected in the
same way as the current sales tax on the sale of tangible personal property sold at retail and on the storage, use, or other consumption of tangible
persona! property purchased from any retailer in the City limits.

As stated in Hollister Chapter 3.30, Measure E will continue to impose a general tax, as opposed to a special tax. Revenues from Measure
E will be deposited into the City’s general fund to be used by the City for any city operation or service, including but not limited to, police and fire
protection, graffiti removal, school resource officer, gang intervention, and park and street maintenance.

Under Measure E, the City Council must appoint a citizens’ oversight committee to review and report to the public annually on all Measure
E tax expenditures.

To become law, Measure E must be approved by a majority (50% plus one vote) of the voters in the City of Hollister voting in this election.
