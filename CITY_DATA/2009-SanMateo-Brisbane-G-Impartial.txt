Impartial Analysis of Measure G

The City of Brisbane currently imposes a general transient occupancy
tax, commonly known as the “hotel tax,” pursuant to Chapter 3.24 of the
Brisbane Municipal Code. The tax is imposed upon the occupancy of any
hotel room in the City and is charged to the transient (or guest) who is
entitled to such occupancy. The hotel tax is a general tax, which means that
the tax proceeds are deposited into the City’s general fund and may be used
for any and all municipal purposes.

The existing rate of the hotel tax is ten percent (10%) of the rent charged
by the hotel operator for use of the hotel room. Measure G will amend
Section 3.24.030 in Chapter 3.24 of the Municipal Code by increasing the
tax rate from ten percent (10%) to twelve percent (12%). No other changes
to this section would be made. The additional proceeds will also constitute
general taxes that may be used for any municipal purposes.

Under Proposition 13 and Proposition 218, any increase in a general
tax requires approval by a majority of voters voting upon the ballot measure.
A “Yes” vote on Measure G is a vote in favor of the 2% increase in the
hotel tax; a “No” vote on Measure G is a vote against the 2% increase. If
approved by a majority of the voters, the 2% increase will become effective
10 days after the date on which result of the vote is declared by the Brisbane
City Council.
