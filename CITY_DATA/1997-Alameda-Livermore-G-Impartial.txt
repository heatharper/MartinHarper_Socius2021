Currently, the City levies an assessment of $11.74 per benefit unit on property
owners to cover the cost of emergency medical services within the City. The
number of “benefit units” allocated to each property owner is determined by the
use of the property. Uses which have historically had more calls for emergency
medical services pay a higher assessment. For example, single family homes
equal one “benefit unit” while nursing homes equal six “benefit units.”

Under newly enacted state law, this existing assessment now qualifies as a
special tax since it funds a specific service, and therefore must be approved by
a two-thirds vote. In accordance with state law, the City Council is submitting
the special tax. If approved, the special tax will be collected from property owners within the City on the property tax rolls annually. This special tax will pay
all the costs associated with the City’s advanced lifesaving paramedic program.

A “yes” vote on the measure is a vote to enact a special tax in the amount of
$11.74 per benefit unit to fund emergency medical services within the City of
Livermore.

A “no” vote on the measure is a vote to reject a special tax in the amount of
$11.74 per benefit unit to fund emergency medical services within the City of
Livermore.

This measure would continue the imposition of $11.74 on taxpayers in the
City of Livermore - as a special tax.
