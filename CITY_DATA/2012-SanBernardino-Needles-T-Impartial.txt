MEASURE T
CITY OF NEEDLES

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS FOR MEASURE T

This Impartial Analysis for Measure T has been prepared by the City
Attorney pursuant to Section 9280 of the Elections Code of the State of
California.

Measure T proposes a 2.5% reduction in the franchise fee the City currently
charges the Needles Public Utility Authority (“NPUA”) from 7.5% to 5%. To offset this
2.5% reduction in the franchise fee, Measure T would impose a Utility Users Tax
(“UUT”) at a rate not to exceed 2.5%, which will be applied to electricity, water, and
sewer utility services. The UUT is a general tax and the revenue the UUT generates
will go to the City of Needles’ general fund for essential government services such as
police and fire, as well as parks and recreation, the aquatics park, the senior center,
the recreation center, the golf course, the animal shelter and other day to day general
City services.

The UUT would be computed on the basis of monthly usage and would be
collected by the utility services provider in accordance with the service provider’s
regular billing practices.

Measure T requires approval of a majority of voters. A “yes” vote for Measure
T will result in the NPUA franchise fees being lowered by 2.5% and a 2.5% UUT being
applied to electricity, water and sewer utility services. A “no” vote against Measure T will result in Measure T failing.
