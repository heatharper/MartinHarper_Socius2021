IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE J

There is no maximum fee under the proposed measure.

This measure, if adopted, would increase the City of East Palo Alto’s
business license fee schedule for businesses whose annual fee is
based on gross receipts. This measure would become effective
January 1, 1998 and would operate annually thereafter but would not
increase except upon approval of the voters.

The current fee schedule ranges from $25 for businesses with gross
receipts of $0 - 25.000 to $750 for businesses with gross receipts of
$2 million or more. Home occupation businesses pay a fee of $10 for
gross receipts of $0 - 5,000. Home occupation businesses with gross
receipts over $5,000 pay the regular fee.

The proposed measure, the full text of which is available in the City
Clerk’s office, would establish a minimum fee of $50 annually for
all businesses with gross receipts of $1.000 or less. The measure provides for a graduated increase in fees based upon increased gross
receipts. The rate structure is as follow's:

Gross Receipts	Fee

SO-$1,000	$50

$1,001 - $100,000	$125

$100,001 -$250,000	$250

$250,001 - $500,000	$500

There is no maximum fee under the proposed measure. 

Business license fees are deposited into the City's General Fund and
can be used for a variety of general governmental purposes, including but not limited to:

•	increased senior citizen services

•	after-school and summer youth programs

•	parks and recreation facilities

•	housing safety and health inspections

Expenditures from the General Fund must be audited every year by
an independent auditor.

Under this measure certain businesses would be eligible for a limited credit of utility users taxes paid in the prior calendar year toward
the current year business license fee.

As the proposed measure is deemed to be an increase in a general
tax, it must be approved by a majority of eligible voters voting on the
measure at the July 22, 1997 special election.
