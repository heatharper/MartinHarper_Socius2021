The City’s Hotel/Motel Tax is paid by guests staying 30 days or less at hotels,
motels, inns and similar lodging establishments in Fremont. This general tax is
used to fund basic City services, including Police, Fire and Maintenance services. This tax was last approved by the voters in 1988, at the rate of 7%, in
accordance with the requirements of Proposition 62, which was passed by the
voters in November 1986. Subsequently, a California Court of Appeals decision
determined that Proposition 62’s voter approval requirements for a general tax
imposed by a local government violated certain provisions of the California
Constitution and was no longer applicable. Therefore, the City Council increased the Hotel/Motel Tax rate to 8% in 1994 and did not seek voter approval.
Subsequently the California Supreme Court found that Proposition 62 did apply
which means that voter approval may now be required.

Because it is not clear whether voter approval is required, voters are being asked
to affirm the previous increase of 1%. If the voters approve this ballot measure,
the Hotel/Motel Tax rate will remain at 8%, the rate that has been in place since
1994. If the voters reject the City Council’s action and the rate reverts to 7%,
the estimated loss to the City’s General Fund will be approximately $110,000
this year. It is estimated this loss will grow to $350,000 a year within five years.

In summary, this general tax is collected from visitors on the rental of
hotel/motel rooms in Fremont and is assessed as a percentage (currently 8%) of
the room rent. It can be used for any purpose that is a legal government purpose
and is used by the City to fund basic services.
