Impartial Analysis from City Attorney

City of Santa Cruz Temporary Transactions and Use Tax TEMPORARY (FIVE YEAR) CITY ONE-QUARTER PERCENT SALES TAX INCREASE

This ballot measure, if adopted by the voters, would enact a temporary five-year one-quarter of one percent (0.25%) increase to the sales tax rate in the City of Santa Cruz.

The sales tax is also referred to as a "transactions and use tax." The current sales tax rate in the City of Santa Cruz is eight percent (8%). Accordingly, if this ballot measure is adopted the sales tax rate would increase to eight-and one-quarter (8.25%) percent for the next five years. The proposed increased sales tax, like the current sales tax, would be imposed upon the sale of all tangible personal property sold at retail within the jurisdictional limits of the City as well as upon the storage, use or other consumption of tangible personal property purchased from any retailer in the jurisdictional limits of the City.
All revenue generated from the proposed sales tax increase would be deposited into the City's General Fund and, accordingly, all monies collected pursuant to the sales tax increase would be used by the City to pay for general City operations and services. As such, this ballot measure proposes a "general purpose tax," rather than a "special purpose tax," and requires a simple majority vote for adoption.
