CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE P

Measure P, if approved by a majority vote of the City's voters would enact a one
quarter of one percent (0.25%) increase to the “Transaction and Use Tax” (commonly referred to as "sales tax") on each dollar of taxable sales of goods within the
City of Santa Rosa and on storage, use or consumption in the City of Santa Rosa of
goods purchased from a retailer collected at the same time and in the same manner as other sales tax.

The tax is considered a general tax under state law. As a result, if approved, the
revenues from the tax would be placed in the City's general fund and may be used
for general City operations and programs such as police and fire services, street
maintenance, park and recreational programs including gang prevention and any
other governmental functions and services.

The tax would continue for a period of eight (8) years from the date of commencement. Any extension to the duration of the proposed tax beyond eight (8) years
would require action by the City Council and a new vote of the public.

Expenditure of the funds would be subject to an annual independent financial audit.

A “yes" vote on Measure P would increase the sales tax rate in the City of Santa
Rosa from the current nine and one quarter percent (9.25%) to nine and one-half
percent (9.50%).

The proposed tax is authorized by California Revenue and Taxation Code Section
7285.9 subject to approval by two-thirds of the City Council and a Majority of the
voters voting in an election on the tax. On July 27,2010 the Council of the City of
Santa Rosa unanimously approved the proposed measure. A full copy of the text of
the ordinance is printed in these ballot materials.
