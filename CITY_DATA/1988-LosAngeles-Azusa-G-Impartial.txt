CITY ATTORNEYâ€™S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF PROPOSITION G

Proposition G, if approved, would enact Ordinance No. 2378 which would
provide for an annual increase in business licenses for mining, excavation and
wood processing.

Currently, every business within the City of Azusa doing business for the pur-
pose of mining, excavation and wood processing is charged a business license
tax.

Ordinance No. 2378, if enacted, would provide for an annual increase of such
taxes in the percentage increase in the California Consumer Price Index for
the year ending on the prior October 1. The increase would begin January 1,
1989 and each January 1 thereafter.

The ordinance would also allow the City Council to amend the ordinance with-
out a vote of the people but only to the extent necessary to implement the procedures for collection of the tax and to the extent permitted by Government
Code Sections 53720, et seq.
