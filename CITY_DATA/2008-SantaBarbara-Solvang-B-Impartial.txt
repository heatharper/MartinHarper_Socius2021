CITY OF SOLVANG
CITY ATTORNEY'S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS FOR
MEASURE B2008

If approved by the voters, Measure B would amend the Solvang
Municipal Code to increase the tax paid by temporary occupants
of rooms one percentage point. This measure would set the
transient occupancy tax rate at eleven percent (11%). At this
rate, for example, a stay in a hotel $1Q0 in value would generate
a tax of eleven dollars. The tax is not imposed upon the hotel or
motet owner but is imposed upon the temporary, or "transient"
occupant. The owner of the hotel or motel does have a duty to
both collect the tax from the occupant and to remit the tax to the
City of Solvang.

This measure requires all proceeds of the tax to be deposited
into the Cityâ€™s General Fund to be used for such general
municipal governmental purposes, as the City Council shall
direct. Among such purposes are tourism related services,
public bathroom construction and maintenance, street and
sidewalk construction, maintenance and repair, pothole repair,
storm drain construction, maintenance and repair, and police
services. It is estimated that this increase will generate two
hundred thousand ($200,000.00) or more on an annual basis
from the visitors that will pay the tax.

The transient occupancy tax increase proposed by this measure
will only become effective if approved by a majority of those
electors voting on the measure.

A YES vote approves the measure.

A NO vote rejects the measure
