CITY OF PORT HUENEME
IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY

MEASURE "W"

Measure W proposes to raise revenue for general city of Port Hueneme
purposes by authorizing a 1/2 cent sales tax within Port Hueneme. The tax would
be paid in addition to current sales taxes and would be collected at the same
time and in the same manner as existing sales taxes. California law authorizes
the City Council to impose this sales tax, provided the tax is approved by a
majority of the voters.

Measure W would be a "general tax." Consequently, all revenue generated from
the proposed sales tax would be deposited into the City’s General Fund and
would be available for use by the City to pay for general City operations and
services. The City would not be legally bound in any way to use the tax monies
for any special purpose or for any particular facilities or programs. Since this
ballot measure proposes a "general tax" rather than a "special purpose tax," it
requires approval by a simple majority of the City’s voters.

A "yes" vote on Measure W favors adopting a one-half cent sales tax.

A "no" vote on Measure W opposes adopting a one-half cent sales tax.
