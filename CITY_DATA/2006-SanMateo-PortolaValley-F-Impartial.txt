IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE F

This ballot measure asks whether the people of the Town of
Portola Valley wish to lower the existing five and one-half percent (5.5%)
Utility Users Tax levied on telephone, gas, water and electricity charges to
four and one-half percent (4.5%) for a period of three years and five
months, from February 1, 2007 through June 30, 2010, at which time the
tax will revert to five and one-half percent (5.5%). A “Yes” vote means the
voter is in favor of reducing the Utility Users Tax to four and one-half
percent (4.5%). A “No” vote means the voter is not in favor of reducing the
Utility Users Tax. In order for the tax to be reduced to four and one-half
percent (4.5%), the ballot measure must be approved by more than fifty
percent (50%) of the voters voting on the measure.

The proceeds from the Utility Users Tax are deposited into the Town’s
General Fund and are expended for general governmental purposes,
including, but not limited to, the maintenance of streets, parks, trails and
drainage structures. If the ballot measure does not receive a favorable
majority vote, the five and one-half percent (5.5%) Utility Users Tax will
continue to be levied and collected at a rate of five and one-half
percent (5.5%).

This ballot measure does not affect the Town’s second Utility Users
Tax, a two percent (2%) Utility Users Tax on telephone, gas, water and
electricity charges, the proceeds of which are deposited into the Town’s
restricted Open Space Fund.
