Impartial Analysis from City Attorney


This ballot measure, if adopted by the voters, would enact a temporary five-year one-quarter of one percent (1/4%) increase to the sales tax rate in the City of Capitola. The sales tax is also referred to as a "transactions and use tax." The current sales tax rate in the City of Capitola is eight percent (8%).
Accordingly, if this ballot measure is adopted the Capitola sales tax rate would increase to eight-and-one-quarter (8 1/4%) percent for the next five years, increasing the cost of retail sales subject to the tax by 25 cents for every $100 of eligible sales consummated. (If County voters, by a two-thirds majority vote, in this election enact a separate countywide special one-half percent (1/2%) sales tax for transportation infrastructure improvements and Highway 1 widening, that sales tax increase in conjunction with this sales tax increase would result in an 8 3/4 percent sales tax rate which in five years, with the sunset of this sales tax increase, would be reduced to 8 1/2 percent.)
The proposed increased Capitola sales tax, like the current Capitola sales tax, would be imposed upon the sale of all tangible personal property sold at retail within the jurisdictional limits of Capitola as well as upon the storage, use or other consumption of tangible personal property purchased from any retailer in the jurisdictional limits of Capitola.
All revenue generated from the proposed sales tax increase would be deposited into the City's General Fund and, accordingly, all monies collected pursuant to the sales tax increase would be used by the City to pay for general City operations and programs including public safety and street improvements. As such, this ballot measure proposes a "general purpose tax," rather than a "special purpose tax," and requires a simple majority vote for adoption.
