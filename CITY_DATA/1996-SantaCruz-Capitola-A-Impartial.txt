IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
CITY OF CAPITOLA MEASURE A

The proposed measure would establish voter approval of Resolution No. 2524, a one and a half percent increase in the City’s
Transient Occupancy Tax from a rate of eight percent to nine and
one-half percent.

Capitola’s Transient Occupancy Tax was first established in 1982
at the rate of eight percent. The Municipal Code defines transients
as persons occupying rooms in hotels, motels, inns or similar businesses for less than a thirty-day period. They are required to pay a
tax which consists of a percentage of the amounts charged by the
operator of the facility in which they stay.

In November of 1986 the voters of California enacted Proposition
62. Proposition 62 prohibited new general taxes unless approved
by a four-fifths vote of the City Council and a majority.of the voters.

California Court of Appeal decisions issued following the passage
of Proposition 62 seemingly invalidated it. However, in December
of 1995 the California Supreme Court ruled that Proposition 62 was
valid. The California Supreme Court has not specifically ruled concerning whether an increase in an existing tax is prohibited by
Proposition 62. The original tax of eight percent is unaffected by
Proposition 62. The one and one-half increase was adopted by the
City Council after Proposition 62 was enacted, but, prior to this
Measure A, has not been submitted for voter approval. Its validity is
therefore in doubt. Voter approval of Measure A would resolve the
question of whether the one and a half percent increase can legally
be collected by the City of Capitola.
