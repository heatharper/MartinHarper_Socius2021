Summary Prepared by Oakland City Attorney
This measure modernizes the existing telephone utility users tax (UUT) without increasing the current tax rate of 7.5% on charges for telephone use in Oakland. The measure uses modern definitions that will remain current despite changes in technology. It will tax telephone communications services in a uniform and equitable manner, regardless of the means of transmission or technology used. Revenue from the UUT is deposited in the City's general fund to be used for municipal services and general governmental purposes. Approval of the measure requires a vote by the majority of the electorate.
