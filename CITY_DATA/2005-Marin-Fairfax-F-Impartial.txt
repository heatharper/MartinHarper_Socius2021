IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY TOWN ATTORNEY	MEASURE F



This measure, if passed by two-thirds (2/3) of the voters, would add Sections 3.20.080 and 3.20.090 to the Fairfax Town Code, imposing a special tax at a maximum rate of one hundred twenty-five dollars ($125.00) on each improved residential and business parcel within the boundaries of the town of Fairfax for a period of five (5) years. The measure requires that the revenue from the tax be used exclusively for the specific purposes of maintaining 24-hour, seven days per week staffing of the Fairfax Police Station and Fire House, maintaining Fairfax's 911 Emergency Dispatch, performing Public Works safety improvements, restoring funding for Youth Services and establishing a citizens’ oversight committee to ensure that the tax revenue is spent accordingly.	

The remaining sections of Chapter 3.20 of the Fairfax Town Code shall remain unchanged.	

A "YES” vote would be a vote to impose the tax, subject to the conditions and restrictions stated above.	

A "NO” vote would be a vote to not impose the tax.
