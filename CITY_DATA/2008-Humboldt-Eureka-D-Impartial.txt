IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
MEASURE D

This ballot measure, if adopted by the voters, would enact a one-
quarter of one percent (1/4%) increase to the sales tax rate in the
City of Eureka

The current sales tax (also referred to as a "Transactions and Use
Tax.") rate in the City of Eureka is seven and one-quarter percent
(7.25%). If this ballot measure is adopted the Eureka sales tax rate
would increase to seven and one-half percent (7-1/2%), increasing
the cost of retail sales subject to the tax, for example, by two and
one-half (2-1/2) cents for every $10 of eligible sales consummated.
The proposed increased Eureka sales tax, like the current Eureka
sales tax, would be imposed upon the sale of all tangible personal
property sold at retail within the jurisdictional limits of Eureka as
well as upon the storage, use or other consumption of tangible
personal property purchased from any retailer in the jurisdictional
limits of Eureka.

All revenue generated from the proposed sales tax increase would
be deposited into the City's General Fund and, accordingly, all monies
collected pursuant to the sales tax increase would be used by the
City to pay for general City operations and programs including police,
fire, street maintenance, environmental programs, parks and
recreation, and zoo operations. As such, this ballot measure proposes
a "general purpose tax," rather than a "special purpose tax," and
requires a simple majority vote for adoption.

A yes vote would increase the sales tax rate in the City of Eureka
from 7.25% to 7.5%.

A no vote would leave the sales tax rate in the City of Eureka at
7.25%.
