Proposition H approves an ordinance which imposes a special tax to finance additional police
protection by the employment of up to one hundred additional police officers, primarily assigned patrol
duties, and the equipment and expenses required to support them. It establishes the maximum tax rates
and authorizes the Long Beach City Council to thereafter levy the special tax annually up to the maximum
rates. The basis for the tax and maximum tax rates are established in the proposed new Chapter 3.95 of
the Long Beach Municipal Code as set forth in the votersâ€™ pamphlet. A Special Police Tax Fund is
established to receive all special taxes collected, and the ordinance expressly provides that all taxes
collected must be used exclusively for the purpose for which the tax is proposed and for no other purpose.
The annual rate of the special tax may not exceed the maximum rate as automatically adjusted based upon
the Consumer Price Index of the Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim Metropolitan Area. The Proposition
also includes provisions for refunds, the installment payment of taxes and authorization for the City Council
to enact procedural amendments.
