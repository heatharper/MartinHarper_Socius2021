CITY ATTORNEY IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS
OF MEASURE D
CITY OF WILLIAMS

Measure D proposes to raise revenue for general City of Williams purposes by authorizing a 0.5 percent (i.e., 1/2 cent) sales tax within the City of
Williams. 100% of the proceeds would remain in the
City of Williams. The tax would be paid in addition to
current state and local sales taxes and would be collected at the same time and in the same manner as
the existing sales taxes.

California Revenue and Taxation Code Section
7285.9 authorizes the Williams City Council to levy
transactions and use (i.e., a “sales”) tax at certain
rates, including a 0.5 percent (i.e., 1/2 cent) rate provided the tax is approved by a majority of the voters
voting in an election on that issue. If approved the
Measure D sales tax would become effective April 1,
2007, and would remain in effect until March 31,
2013, a period of six years. The tax would expire at
the end of the six-year period unless it is reauthorized
by a majority of the voters in another election.

Measure D states that the 1/2 cent sales tax is to
be used for funding “essential services such as road
maintenance, fire/police services, and other general
governmental purposes.” Because this sales tax
would be a “general tax,” the City of Williams would
be able to use tax proceeds for any legal governmental purpose without restriction. The City of Williams
would not be legally bound in any way to use the tax
monies for any special purpose or for any particular
program or service.

The measure requires that the City of Williams
publish an annual report on General Fund expenditures, and requires a public hearing by the Williams
City Council every three years to determine whether
the tax is still necessary.
