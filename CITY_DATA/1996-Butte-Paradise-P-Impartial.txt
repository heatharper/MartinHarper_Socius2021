TOWN ATTORNEYâ€™S IMPARTIAL
ANALYSIS OF MEASURE P

Currently the Town of Paradise imposes a six percent (6%)
transient occupancy tax on the guests of hotels, motels and
like-kind establishments doing business in the Town.

On August 6, 1996, the Town Council of the Town of
Paradise approved Ordinance No. 2ZZ amending Paradise
Municipal Code section 3.24.030 by increasing the amount
of the transient occupancy tax from six percent (6%) to ten
percent (10%). A yes vote on this measure by a majority of
the voting electors is necessary for the ordinance to become
effective.

Based upon the past amounts of transient occupancy taxes
collected within the Town, the estimated amount of additional revenue from the tax increase would be $19,541 per
year.

All revenues generated by the tax increase would be deposited in the Town's general fund and would be allocated for
general municipal purposes.
