CITY ATTORNEY IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS
Of MEASURE N

Measure "N" on the ballot provides “Shall the proposed ordinance repealing City-Wide Park Maintenance
District 98-1 be approval?’"

The full full text of the proposed ordinance follows this Impartial Analysis. The ordinance will not be effective
unless and until approved by a vote of not less than a majority of those voting on this Measure and provided
further that this Measure receives more affirmative votes than Measure “M” which also appears on the ballot.

The ordinance is on the ballot because of the Initiative Measure to Repeal City-Wide Park Maintenance Assessment District 98-1. 

The ordinance would dissolve City-Wide Park Maintenance Assessment District 98-1 In April 1998,
Brentwood property owners voted to assess themselves a maximum $79 a year, per single family dwelling,
to maintain park and recreational facilities in Brentwood Other land uses, such as multi-family, commercial,
public property and agricultural, were also assessed at different amounts. The ordinance would terminate the
park, assessments

The ordinance also directs that all funds that have been collected for park maintenance be transferred to the
City's general fund, it purports to repeal the levy of assessments for Fiscal Year 1998-99 and orders the City to discontinue collection of the assessments. It purports to ban the City from forming a similar District or
levying assessments on property owners in the City for park maintenance, but would allow the City to propose
for voter approval a special tax for park maintenance One of the differences between a park maintenance
assessment district and a special tax is that a special tax requires two-thirds voter approval at an election
whereas an assessment district requires a majority approval by those property owners submitting ballots.
Finally, the ordinance could only be amended by a vote of the People,

The above objectives of the ordinance are extensively regulated by the California Constitution and other State
laws and it is not dear how the provisions of the ordinance would be interpreted by the Courts.

A 'yes’ vote means you are in favor of Measure “N“ and the repeal of the City’s park maintenance funding
program and a 'no' vote means you are opposed to Measure “N" and support the City’s park maintenance
funding program.
