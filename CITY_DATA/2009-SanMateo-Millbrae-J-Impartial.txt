Impartial Analysis of Measure J	

The California Constitution, the Government Code and the Revenue and
Taxation Code authorize the City of Millbrae to levy or increase a general
tax in the form of a transient occupancy tax, better known as the “Hotel
Tax,” upon a majority vote approval of the Millbrae electorate. The City
Council of the City of Millbrae has enacted Ordinance No. 725 to increase
the existing Hotel Tax from 10% to 12% and has placed this Measure on the
ballot seeking the required voter approval to make the tax increase effective
as of January 1, 2010.

The Hotel Tax is placed on the room rent charged to guests who stay in
hotels, motels, inns, or similar lodgings in the City of Millbrae. The tax is
collected by the operators of these lodging facilities as part of the room bills.
The City estimates that the revenues from this 2% increase in the Hotel Tax
will generate a minimum of $400,000 per year. These revenues are placed
in the City’s General Fund for general governmental purposes to support
police, fire, public works, parks, recreation programs, the library facility
and services, code enforcement, and the maintenance and improvement of
City infrastructure and facilities.

A “Yes” vote on this Measure would approve the 2% increase in the
Hotel Tax authorized by Millbrae City Council’s Ordinance No. 725
to go into effect on January 1, 2010.

A “No” vote on this Measure would not allow the implementation of
the 2% tax increase in the Hotel Tax and the Hotel Tax in Millbrae
would remain at 10%.
