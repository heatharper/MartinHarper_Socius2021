Impartial Analysis from the City Attorney

The City of Oakland business tax ordinance for many years has required that businesses pay taxes on various types of business activities if they do business in the City.
If adopted, this measure would amend two provisions of the business tax ordinance to ensure that businesses receive the same tax treatment regardless of their location in or outside of the City. The United States and California Constitutions require that cities impose the same tax treatment on businesses regardless of their location inside or outside of a city.
First, the measure would amend the City's manufacturing tax (Municipal Code Section 5.04.390). Under the current ordinance, local manufacturers may deduct the value of raw materials from their gross receipts. The amendments would extend such deduction to all businesses engaged in manufacturing regardless of business location. This would reduce eligible manufacturers' tax liability. The amendments also would clarify that Oakland manufacturers are not subject to taxation on business activities conducted outside of Oakland.
Second, this measure would amend Oakland's administrative headquarters tax (Municipal Code Section 5.04.400). Currently, some businesses with administrative headquarters in Oakland may pay taxes based only on payroll and may not pay gross receipts taxes on revenue from some of their other business activities at the administrative headquarters location. The amendment would clarify that businesses with administrative headquarters in the City of Oakland will pay taxes on all business activities at the administrative headquarters.
