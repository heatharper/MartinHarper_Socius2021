TOWN ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS
OF MEASURE C

If this measure is approved by the requisite two-thirds
vote, an ordinance shall be adopted in the Town of Corte
Madera imposing a special tax for paramedic and/or emergency medical services (EMS). This is not the first time an
EMS tax has been submitted to and approved by the
Town’s voters. A special EMS tax was first approved by
the Town’s voters on June 7, 1983 and has since received
continuous voter approval. The present special EMS tax
was approved by the Town’s voters in November of 2006.
Since that tax will expire on June 30, 2011, voter approval
of this measure is required in order to continue the provision of EMS services.

If approved, this measure will impose a yearly tax for
EMS services for the next four fiscal years. For fiscal year

2011-2012, the tax amount will be $60.00 for each residential unit. For nonresidential uses, the tax rate for fiscal
year 2011-2012 will be $60.00 per 1,000 square feet of
enclosed floor area. The tax rate on residential and non-
residential uses shall increase $5.00 per year for each of
the remaining three years the tax is in effect. In fiscal year
2014-2015, the yearly tax shall be $75.00 for each residential unit and $75.00 for each 1,000 square feet of
enclosed floor area for nonresidential uses.

The measure provides that the tax proceeds must be
placed in a special fund which may only be used for the
provision of EMS services. The tax amount specified
above may not be increased without the approval of two-
thirds of the Town voters. The measure also provides that
the EMS tax will be collected by the Marin County Tax
Collector along with the property tax. As stated above, the
tax will automatically terminate on June 30, 2015.
