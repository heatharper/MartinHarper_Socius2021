MEASURE“C”

ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY

Measure C, if approved by the voters, would impose a tax in the amount of three percent
of the value of any admissions tickets sold in connection with an event, and a tax of twenty-
five cents on any free pass or complimentary ticket for an event. The measure defines an
“event” to include theme parks, sporting events, theatres, contests, exhibitions, amusement
rides and other forms of recreation. The Measure requires each operator of an event to obtain
an admissions tax collections certificate before conducting an event, and establishes
administrative procedures for collection of the tax. The Measure further exempts charitable,
non-profit, religious and other certain organizations from collection of the tax. The first three
hundred thousand dollars of all taxes received by the City are required by the Measure to
be used for youth and senior activities, with the remaining proceeds of the taxes being
deposited into the City’s General Fund.
