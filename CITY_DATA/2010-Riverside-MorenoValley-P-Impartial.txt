CODE TO INCREASE THE EXISTING TRANSIENT
OCCUPANCY TAX RATE FROM 8% T011%.

A “yes” vote on Measure “P” will amend the Moreno Valley Municipal
Code to increase the transient occupancy tax rate to 11%.

A “no” vote will maintain the City’s transient occupancy tax at the existing
rate of 8%.

Measure “P”, if adopted by the City of Moreno Valley voters, would
amend Section 3.24.030 of the City of Moreno Valley Municipal Code
increasing the transient occupancy tax rate from 8% to 11%.

A transient occupancy tax is a tax imposed on the rental of a room at a
hotel, motel, or other lodging establishment for 30 calendar days or less.
This is commonly referred to as a “Hotel Tax.” This tax is only paid by
renters of rooms at these establishments and is not a fax on the
operators or owners of these establishments.

The City’s current transient occupancy tax rate of 8% has been the same
for the past 26 years.

Revenue generated by the transient occupancy tax has been, and will
continue to be, deposited into the City's General Fund for general
governmental purposes such as police, fire, parks, and street
maintenance. If Measure “P” is adopted, the increase in the transient
occupancy tax rate will take effect 10 days after the City Council certifies
the election results.
