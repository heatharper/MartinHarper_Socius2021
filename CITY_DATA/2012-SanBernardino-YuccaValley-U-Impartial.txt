MEASURE U
TOWN OF YUCCA VALLEY

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS FOR MEASURE U

This Impartial Analysis for Measure U has been prepared by the Town
Attorney pursuant to Section 9280 of the Elections Code of the State of
California.

The Town of Yucca Valley Council has placed Measure U on the ballot, which
would approve an ordinance enacting a one cent (10) transactions and use (sales) tax
within the city limits of the Town of Yucca Valley. If Measure U is approved by the
voters, some of the local services and programs that may receive funding include:
sewer system financing and implementation, 9-1-1 response, neighborhood police
patrols, streets and other general municipal services.

Measure U revenues would be legally deposited into the Town’s General
Fund and are protected from the State pursuant to law. All Measure U funds are
required to be spent locally for Yucca Valley services. Measure U would last for a
period of thirty (30) years.

Visitors to the Town of Yucca Valley, as well as residents, would pay the
sales tax. Consistent with State law, Measure U is not applied to prescription
medication or food purchased as groceries. Measure U is subject to annual
independent audits by an independent citizen-based committee.

If Measure U is adopted, the Yucca Valley sales tax rate would go from the
current rate 7.75% to 8.75%. If adopted, the one cent (10) transactions and use
(sales) tax would be effective April, 2013.

To be adopted, State law requires that this Measure be approved by a
majority (50%) of the Town’s voters.

A “Yes” vote on Measure U would adopt the ordinance implementing a one
cent (10) transactions and use (sales) tax rate in Yucca Valley.

A “No” vote would not adopt the ordinance implementing a one cent (10)
transactions and use (sales) tax rate in Yucca Valley.
