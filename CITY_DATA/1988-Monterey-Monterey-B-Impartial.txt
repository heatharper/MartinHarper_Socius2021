MEASURE B

This measure was placed on the ballot by the City Council. It proposes
amend the Monterey City Charter by adding Section 6.16 entitled “Neighborhood Improvement and Community Projects”. This will place in the Charter
an existing program to construct capital improvements in residential neighborhoods, such as sidewalks, parks, improved storm drain and sanitary sew
systems, and projects of special benefit to the residential neighborhoods
well as projects of general benefit to all residents such as recreational facilities
and other public buildings.

Each budget year, 16% of the Transient Occupancy Tax will be allocated
to the program. A committee composed of at least one representative from
each neighborhood will be appointed by the City Council. This committee 
recommend to the City Council the projects for which these funds should
spent. From these recommendations the City Council will select the projects
to be constructed with the available funds.

This does not preclude the City Council from spending other available City
funds on additional capital improvements. If, in any budget year, other City
funds are not sufficient to meet the operating expenses of the City, the County
may reduce the 16% budgeted from the Transient Occupancy Tax to a less
amount.
