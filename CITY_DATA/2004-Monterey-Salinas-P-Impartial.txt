IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
MEASURE P

Because the City of Salinas does not have a dedicated source
of funding for first responder paramedic and enhanced emergency
medical and related services presently being provided, all such
services are financed through the City’s General Fund. This proposed
special tax provides for the funding of first responder paramedic
and enhanced emergency medical and related services through an
annual assessment of $20.00 per service unit to be levied against
each parcel of real property within the City. If approved by two thirds
of the voters, it is projected that the proposed measure would raise
approximately $800,000 in its first year. This funding under California
law would be dedicated to the City’s paramedic program and for no
other purpose. The proposed special tax would expire on June 30,
2014, unless subsequently approved for extension by the voters in
accordance with California law.
