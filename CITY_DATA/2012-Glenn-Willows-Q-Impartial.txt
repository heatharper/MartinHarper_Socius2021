CITY OF WILLOWS MEASURE
TO INCREASE THE HOTEL USERS TAX

Impartial Analysis by the City Attorney

Section 3.25.030 of the City of Willows Municipal Code currently imposes a ten percent
(10%) “Hotel Users Tax,” on persons occupying “Hotels” in the City of Willows. The
City Council of the City of Willows desires to enact an ordinance amending Section

3.25.030	to increase the Hotel Users Tax to 12%. Therefore, the City Council is
submitting the following question to the voters at the general municipal election to be
held in the City of Willows on Tuesday, November 6, 2012:

“Shall the ordinance increasing the Hotel Users Tax from ten
percent (10%) to twelve percent (12%) be adopted?”

The Tax is normally paid by the hotel user to the operator of the hotel at the time payment
for the room rental is made. The hotel operator is required to collect the tax, and the
operator remits the tax to the City of Willows. The tax revenues are paid into the City’s
General Fund and used to pay for municipal activities and services including police
protection, fire protection, library, recreational programs and public works.

The California Constitution, Article 13C requires that “No local government may impose,
extend or increase any general tax unless and until that tax is submitted to the electorate
and approved by a majority vote.” This measure is therefore submitted to the electorate
for their approval or rejection.

A “Yes” vote would approve the adoption by ordinance of a twelve percent (12%) “Hotel
Users Tax” and would increase the City’s General Fund revenues by approximately
$80,000.00.

A “No” vote would reject the measure and would mean that the City’s revenues from the
“Hotel Users Tax” would remain at ten percent (10%).
