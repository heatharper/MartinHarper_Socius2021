If approved by the voters, Ordinance No. 209 would validate the 1994 adoption
of a tax on operators of oil and gas wells. Ordinance No. 209 would reimpose that
tax, amend it as described below, and validate taxes previously collected under
the tax.

The existing tax imposes an annual wellhead fee of $500 per oil or gas well
operated in the City, and imposes quarterly production fees of 20 cents per barrel
of oil produced, 4 cents per 1,000 cubic feet of gas produced, and 3 cents per 1,000
cubic feet of gas re-extracted from a storage facility. The existing tax provides
procedures for its collection, enforcement and administration.

Ordinance No. 209 would amend the existing tax to extend it to idle wells. At
present, the annual wellhead fee is paid annually on wells which are active when
the fee is paid. Annual wellhead fees for idle wells which are later re-activated
are paid when the wells become active. Ordinance No. 209 would extend the
annual wellhead fee to all wells, eliminate the exemption for idle wells, and
require a single annual payment of wellhead fees for all wells. Ordinance No. 209
would not change the current tax rates.

Ordinance No. 209 is proposed in response to a recent California Supreme Court
decision. When the existing tax was adopted, courts had ruled that general taxes
could be adopted by the City Council without a vote of the electorate. General
taxes are taxes devoted to general city services such as police, fire, park
maintenance, etc. and are not restricted to a special or limited purpose. The
California Supreme Court recently overturned those earlier decisions, holding
that general taxes do require voter approval. The City Council therefore proposed
Ordinance No. 209 to allow the voters to validate the tax on oil and gas wells.
