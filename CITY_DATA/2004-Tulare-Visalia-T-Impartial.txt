IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
MEASURE T

Measure T proposes to raise revenue for the purpose of funding
police and fire facilities, equipment and personnel, by authorizing a
sales tax of one-fourth of a cent within the City of Visalia. The tax
would be paid in addition to the current state and local sales taxes
and would be collected at the same time and in the same manner as
existing sales taxes.

California Revenue and Taxation Code Section 7286.44 authorizes
the City Council to levy a transaction and use tax (i.e., a “sales”) tax
at a rate not to exceed 0.25 percent if the tax is approved by two
thirds of the qualified voters of the city voting in an election on that
issue. If approved by the voters, the sales tax will be adopted by
ordinance to become effective no sooner than May 1, 2004.

The revenues raised from the sales tax will be used to hire and equip
28 additional police officers and 18 new firefighters. It will provide for
opening of two new police precincts and two new fire stations. The
revenues will also be used to improve the 911 emergency dispatch
center to decrease emergency response time.

The sales tax increases will be subject to certain conditions included
in a plan adopted by the City Council. Such conditions provide that
the expenditures of money pursuant to the plan be independently
audited on an annual basis and that a citizen’s advisory committee
review the auditor’s report and report to the community their findings.
The City Manager is required to re-certify the plan of expenditures
annually at the time of submittal of the budget to the City Council and
every eight years the City Council must reaffirm the need for the
public safety sales tax by a four-fifths vote.
