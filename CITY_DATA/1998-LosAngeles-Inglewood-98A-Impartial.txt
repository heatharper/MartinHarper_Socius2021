CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF PROPOSITION 98-A

(Parking Tax)

The Parking Tax is a tax on the rent for every occupancy of parking space in a parking station which occurs in the
City of Inglewood. It is commonly referred to as a ‘Visitor- oriented” tax since the burden of the tax falls on the user of the
parking space, often a visitor to the City. The tax has been in effect since 1972.

The proposed Ordinance will increase the tax from 5% to 10% and is expected to result in an increase in revenues
of $300,000 annually. The increased tax rate is the same as that charged by the City of Los Angeles.
