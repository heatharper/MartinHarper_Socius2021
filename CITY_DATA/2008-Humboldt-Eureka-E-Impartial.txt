IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
MEASURE E

The City of Eureka currently imposes a tax in the amount of 9% of
the rent charged to persons who stay at a hotel within the Eureka
City limits. This tax is called the transient occupancy tax ("TOT").
The tax is paid by the hotel room occupant directly to the hotel
operator at the time the occupant pays his or her hotel bill. Hotel
operators hold the collected taxes in trust for the benefit of the City
and remit the taxes quarterly to the City tax administrator.

If this measure is approved by the electorate, the TOT shall increase
by 1% from the present 9% rate to 10%. Therefore, if this measure
is approved, a person who stays in a hotel within the City of Eureka
will pay 10% of the rent charged by the hotel operator as a TOT.
All of the TOT revenues collected by the City are used, and shall
continue to be used, for City general fund purposes.

The ordinance proposed by this ballot measure will be adopted if
this measure is approved by a simple majority of those electors
voting on the measure at the November 5, 2008 election.

A "yes" vote would approve an increase in the City's TOT by 1%. A
"no" vote would reject the proposed 1% increase in the City's TOT.
