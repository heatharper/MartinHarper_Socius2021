IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
MEASURE K

If approved by a majority of the voters voting in the November 2, 2004
election, Measure K would enact an ordinance increasing the City of
Mission Viejo’s transient occupancy tax. The proposed ordinance would
increase the tax rate from its current rate of eight percent (8%) to a new rate
of ten percent (10%) of the rent charged to a person occupying a hotel room
within the City.

The proposed ordinance also provides that proceeds of the tax would be
collected by the City and placed into the City’s General Fund to be used for
general municipal purposes and shall not be pledged or designated for any
particular use. Under the terms of the proposed ordinance and the California
Constitution, only the voters of the City of Mission Viejo could increase the
tax rate, convert it to a special tax pledged for a particular purpose, or
expand the application of the tax.

The above statement is an impartial analysis of Measure K by the City
Attorney pursuant to Elections Code Section 9280.
