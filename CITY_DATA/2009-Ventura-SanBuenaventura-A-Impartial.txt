

CITY OF SAN BUENAVENTURA
IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
MEASURE “A”

If approved by a majority of the voters, Measure A will
allow a temporary one-half percent (0.5%) increase in
Ventura's sales tax, technically called the “transactions
and use tax.” The increase would be in effect four years,
from April 1, 2010 to March 31, 2014.

Creates General Tax Revenue For Any Local General
Government Purpose

The tax revenues will be deposited in the City of Ventura’s
general fund, and may be used for any local general
government purposes. The City Council has identified the
following needs for the tax revenue:

Restore police, fire and emergency response times
Provide additional funding for street repair
Keeping Wright Library open
Protecting local beaches from pollution

Independent Citizen’s Oversight Committee

Measure A also establishes an 11-member independent
citizen’s oversight committee. The oversight committee will
meet regularly in public to monitor how the tax revenue is
being spent. The committee must also advise the City
Council on selecting an independent auditor who will audit
the City's expenditures of the tax revenue. The citizen’s
oversight committee must make public reports on how the
revenue is being spent at least every quarter.

Tax Rate Impacts

Measure A’s % percent sales tax would supplement the
existing City of Ventura sales tax. Currently, the combined
state and local sales tax rate in Ventura is 8.25%. That tax
is allocated as follows:

State of California: 7.5%

City of Ventura: 0.717%

County of Ventura: 0.033%

Measure A’s % percent sales tax would increase Ventura’s
share of the sales tax to 1.217% for four years between
April 1, 2010 and March 31, 2014. The city’s new
combined state and local sales tax rate would be 8.75%
