Impartial Analysis Of Proposition G

By Robert E. Shannon, City Attorney

Voter approval of Proposition G would delete
Sections 903,1500,1700,1707,1714,1717 and
1724 from the Long Beach City Charter.

Presently, the Long Beach City Charter contains
provisions establishing taxes for public recreation,
libraries, transportation and the Municipal Band.
The proposed amendment would eliminate these
tax provisions.

Presently, the Long Beach City Charter requires the
establishment of a Department of Public Utilities.
The proposed amendment would eliminate this
requirement.

Presently, the Long Beach City Charter
designates the Cityâ€™s fiscal year, and requires
the establishment of a general purpose reserve
account and limits the amount of funds which
may be placed in that account. The proposed
amendment would eliminate this requirement.
