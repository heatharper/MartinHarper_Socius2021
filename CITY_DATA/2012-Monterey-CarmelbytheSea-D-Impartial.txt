Impartial Analysis from City Attorney

The Carmel-by-the-Sea Vital City Services Measure D proposes
to raise revenue for general purpose use by the City of Carmel-by-
the-Sea by authorizing a temporary one percent (1%) transaction
and use tax (commonly referred to as a "sales tax") for a period of
ten (10) years, to include an independent annual audit of funds.
The one percent (1%) tax would be paid in addition to the current
transaction and use tax and would be collected at the same time
and in the same manner as the existing transaction and uses tax.
