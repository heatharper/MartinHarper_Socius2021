CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE B

This Ballot Measure is about 2% of the existing utility users tax that consumers
pay on gas, electricity, telephone and cable television utility bills. The proceeds
of the tax go to the General Fund to pay for City services and obligations such
as police, fire, recreation, parks, libraries, street maintenance and debt service.
On May 2,1995, the City Council adopted Ordinance No. 2691 which changed
the tax rate from 5.5% to 7.5%. Low income families are eligible for an exemption from the change on all of these utilities. Senior citizens are eligible for an
exemption from the change to their electricity, gas and cable television bills.
Those exempt from the change may continue to pay the tax at the rate of 5.5%
upon application to the City. Senior citizens who choose to pay the full amount
of the tax may direct that the monies be used for Mastick Center. Since 1995,
senior citizens have directed $5,200 annually to the Mastick Center. Since 1995,
every other user of electricity, gas, telephone and cable television has been pay-
ing a utility user’s tax of 7.5%.

The City Council placed this Measure on the ballot to comply with Proposition
218 which requires that any tax increased after January 1995 be submitted for
voter approval. Ordinance 2691 was adopted by the Council on May 2, 1995
and changed the utility users tax from 5.5% to 7.5%. This 2% change must be
approved by voters if it is to remain in effect

Since 1992, the State has taken approximately $3 million per year of the City’s
property tax share that would otherwise go to the General Fund to pay for City
services and obligations. Each year the 2% portion of the utility users tax raises approximately $1.7 million. The City Council adopted the 2% portion of the
utility users tax partly in response to the fact that the State has taken approximately $15.1 million of the property taxes which would have been paid to the
City since 1992.

The 2% portion of the utility users tax amounts to $.90 on a monthly electricity bill of $45 and $.52 on a monthly gas bill of $26. These funds are available
for all General Fund services, however 58% of the General Fund budget is used
for police and fire services.

If this Measure passes, Alameda taxpayers will continue to pay the utility users
tax at the rate of 7.5%. If the Measure fails, Alameda taxpayers will pay the tax
at the rate of 5.5%. If the Measure passes, the General Fund will continue to
receive approximately $1.7 million annually from the 2% portion. If the
Measure fails, the General Fund will have approximately $1.7 million less
annual revenue. The Measure requires a majority vote to pass.

A “yes” vote will allow the existing 2% portion of the utility users tax, adopted
via Ordinance 2691, to continue.

A “no” vote will discontinue the existing 2% portion of the utility users tax,
adopted via Ordinance 2691.
