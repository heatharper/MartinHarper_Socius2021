IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
CITY OF WEST SACRAMENTO
ADVISORY MEASURE J

Advisory Measure “J” is an advisory vote of the citizens of West
Sacramento concerning the expenditure of any new City of West
Sacramento sales tax revenues approved by the voters.

Measure “J” is not a tax and does not create or increase taxes.
Rather Measure “J" allows City of West Sacramento voters to voice
their opinions on whether any new sales tax revenues in the general
fund should be used to provide funds for the repair and maintenance
of city streets, new parks and community facilities, library services,
after-school programs, childcare and senior facilities, expanded police
and fire protection and reductions in utility bills and property tax
assessments.

Advisory Measure “J" is not binding. Section 9603(c) of the
California Elections Code states:

’advisory vote’ means an indication of general voter opinion
regarding the ballot proposal. The results of the advisory vote will
m no manner be controlling on the sponsoring legislative body.”
However, City Councils may use the advisory vote results to
guide them in making future general fund expenditures for the
purposes set forth in this advisory measure.
