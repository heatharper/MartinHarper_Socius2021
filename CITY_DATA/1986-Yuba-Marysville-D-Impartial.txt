IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE REGARDING

The City Council has called an Advisory Municipal Election for the purpose of allowing the voters of the City of Marysville to voice their opinions regarding
whether the sewer service charge imposed pursuant to Section 6.04.120 of the Marysville Municipal Code should be
increased effective January 1, 1987, for all categories of
users.

The present schedule of sewer service
charges imposed pursuant to Section 6.04,120 is as follows:

Residential - Single Family

-	Multiple Family

-	Senior Citizen (either single or multiple family dwellings)

Non-Residential - Class I

Class II

Class III

$3.00

$2.40

$2.40

$3.00 + 19 per
100 cubic feet

$3.00 + 23 per
100 cubic feet

$3.00 + 30 per
100 cubic feet

Class IV	$3.00 + 3 per

100 cubic feet

The proposed	schedule of sewer service

charges are as follows:

USER CATEGORY   MONTHLY FEE

Residential - Single Family	$6.00

-	Multiple Family	$5.40

-	Senior Citizen (either

single or multiple

family dwellings)	$5.40

Non-Residential - Class I	$6.00	+ 29 per

100 cubic feet

Class II	$6.00	+ 34 per

100 cubic feet

Class III	$6.00	+ 45 per

100 cubic feet

Class IV	$6.00	+ 51 per

100 cubic feet

If the advisory proposition should receive
the approval of a majority of the voters, the sewer service charge for each of the user categories would be increased.

The sewer service charge, including any increase, may be utilized .only for the purpose of recovering
all or a portion of the costs of operating the sanitary
sewer system including operation and maintenance and capital and replacement costs.

Inasmuch as the sewer service charge is a
user fee and not a tax, the City Council has the authority
to increase that charge without voter approval. Accordingly, if this measure is rejected by the voters of
the City of Marysville, the City Council would not legally
be precluded from increasing the sewer service charge in
any event.
