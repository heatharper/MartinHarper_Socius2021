IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
MEASURE F98

A MEASURE TO ADOPT AN ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF
GROVER BEACH AMENDING SUBSECTIONS OF ARTICLE X OF THE GROVER BEACH MUNICIPAL CODE

INCREASING THE UTILITY USERS TAX WITH SUCH INCREASE

TO BE USED FOR THE CONSTRUCTION, RECONSTRUCTION,
REPAIR, AND MAINTENANCE OF PUBLIC STREETS

Pursuant to section 9203 of the Elections Code, the following is the City
Attorneyâ€™s true and impartial statement as to the purpose of Measure F98.

Within Grover Beach there currently exists a 1% tax on certain telephone services,
electric services, gas services, water services, and cable television services. If
approved, Measure F98 will (1) increase the tax to 4%, and (2) require the City
Council to use all money and interest from the difference between the current
1% tax and the proposed 4% tax for the construction, reconstriction, repair and
maintenance of public streets within Grover Beach. If approved, Measure F98
will also (1) authorize the City Council to lower but not raise the tax, and (2)
automatically repeal the entire tax on November 1, 2018.
