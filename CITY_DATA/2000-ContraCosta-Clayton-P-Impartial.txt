Impartial Analysis from City Attorney

Measure P was placed on the ballot by the City Council. It asks the voters whether an ordinance should be enacted which would authorize the City Council to impose an excise tax on the use of gas and electricity by residents and businesses located within the City of Clayton. The proposed tax would be at the rate of 2.4% of charges for electricity and gas usage. The tax would be paid by the person or business using the electricity or the gas and would be collected by the company generating, selling, transporting, and/or distributing electricity and gas to customers within the City.
There is currently no excise tax on gas and electricity usage in the City of Clayton. Pursuant to Proposition 218, enacted by the voters in 1996, Measure P requires a simple majority vote of the voters voting at the election for approval. If Measure P is approved, the City Council will be authorized to impose an excise tax on gas and electricity beginning July 1, 2001, or such later date as determined by the city council.
The proposed tax is a general tax which would be placed in the City's general fund. Revenues from the tax would be available for any general municipal purposes. The above statement is an impartial analysis of Measure P.
