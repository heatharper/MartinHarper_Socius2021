IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY

In 1964, the City Council adopted a Transient Room Tax Ordinance. Under this Ordinance, members of the public staying in city hotels are required to pay a transient room tax, also known as the hotel room tax.

Effective August 1,1996, the transient room tax (hotel room tax) was increased by 1%, from 12% to the current rate of 13%. This 1% increase was approved by the City Council in Resolution No. 96-138 on June 18,1996. Proposition 218 (Article XIIIC, Section 2 of the California Constitution) was adopted on November 5, 1996, and requires such increase in the general tax to be submitted to the voters for
approval. For this reason, the City Council has placed the following question on the ballot:

"Shall the August 1996 increase of 1% (from 12% to 13% per Resolution No.96-138) to the tax paid by persons staying in hotels in the City of Fresno
(Transient Room Tax) be approved?”

A “yes” vote on the Measure ratifies the existing 13% hotel room tax.

A “no” vote is a vote against continuing the 13% hotel room tax. The effect of a “no” vote terminates
the 1 % increase, and sets the transient room tax at 12%.

The Measure requires a simple majority vote to pass. If approved by the voters, the hotel room tax
would be fixed at 13%, and could not be increased without voter approval. The City Controller advises
that the 1 % increase to the hotel room tax generates approximately $500,000 annually to the City’s
General Fund.
