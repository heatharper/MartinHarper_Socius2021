CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE D

Under current law, emergency medical services (EMS) are funded by a
county wide assessment on “benefit units,” a city wide assessment, and to a
lesser extent, user fees. Proposition 218, adopted by the voters in November of
1996, modified the current funding structure and as of July 1, 1997 prohibits
the type of county wide and city assessment previously used to fund EMS.

This measure would impose a special tax of $30.84 per residential unit or
equivalent residential unit to replace the City of Albany assessment which provides for emergency medical services. This special tax is intended to make up
the revenue lost under the City of Albany’s current benefit assessment.

This special tax requires passage by a 2/3 vote. There will be no new additional financial impact upon Albany residents or property owners since this is
shifting a previously imposed assessment into a tax. All residents will pay the
same amount as they did under the assessment. The proceeds of the EMS special tax shall be deposited in the EMS fund and shall be used for the sole and exclusive purpose of providing paramedic and ambulance transport services. This
special tax may only be increased by a vote of the people.
