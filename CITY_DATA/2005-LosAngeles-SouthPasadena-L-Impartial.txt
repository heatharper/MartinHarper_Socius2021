Impartial Analysis from City Attorney

This measure would extend the effective date of the current Library special tax to June
30, 2011, a six-year period. The amount of the tax would continue at the same level
approved by the voters in March of 1999. That effective date of the special tax can only
be extended by a two-thirds (2/3) vote of those voting on the measure.

Currently, pursuant to Section 2.89-4 of the South Pasadena Municipal Code, any
revenue generated by the special tax can only be used for maintenance, operating, and
administrative costs of the Library. That restricted use of the special tax revenue would
continue to apply if the measure is adopted.

The annual rate by category for the special tax would also continue at the current rates,
which are:

1.	Single family residences and condominiums pay $24.00 if they are less than 2,000
square feet; $36.00 if between 2,001 and 4,000 square feet; $48.00 if over 4,000 square
feet. "Square feet" refers to square feet of Building Areas as determined by the Los
Angeles County Assessor.

2.	Multi-family residential units, such as apartment buildings, pay $12.00 per Dwelling
Unit on the parcel.

3.	Non-residential parcels pay $24.00 per parcel if one-quarter (1/4) acre or less; $48.00
per parcel if over one-quarter (1/4) acre but one-half (1/2) acre or less; $72.00 per
parcel if over one-half (1/2) acre but three-quarters (3/4) acre or less; $96.00 per parcel
if more than three-quarters (3/4) acre.

4.	The following types of property would remain exempt from the tax:

1.	Parcels owned by charitable or community service organizations or churches that
qualify for an exemption from ad valorem taxation under California law.

2.	Vacant parcels.

3.	Parcels owned by the federal, state or local government, or any state or local agency.

4.	Any owner who has income, adjusted for family size, at or below eighty percent (80%)
of the area median income as determined under the Section 8 Income Limits for Los
Angeles County. (These limits are published by the U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development.)

In addition to the foregoing, the following restrictions would also continue:

If in any year the City Council does not budget and appropriate sufficient funds for the
basic level of library services, the special tax would be fixed at a reduced level in relation
to any reduction in the budget.

Any surplus amounts raised by the special tax in any one year may only be used for the
purposes described in South Pasadena Municipal Code Section 2.89-4, and must be
carried over to the following fiscal year. The existence of a surplus in one year must be
considered by the City in levying the special tax for the next year.

The term of the special tax, if approved by two-thirds (2/3) of the voters voting on the
measure, will be extended for six (6) years (from June 30, 2005 through June 30, 2011)
and any further extension must be approved by two-thirds (2/3) of the voters voting on
such extension at another municipal election.

The special tax will continue to be collected by the Los Angeles County Assessor in the
same manner as property taxes.
