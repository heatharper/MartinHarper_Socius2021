IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY	

The Lindsay Vital City Services Measure proposes to raise revenue by authorizing a general transactions and use tax (“sales tax’’) of three-quarters of a cent (.75 percent), and approving an ordinance adding Chapter 3.13 to Title 3 of the Lindsay Municipal Code. The tax would be paid in addition to the current state and local sales taxes and would be collected at the same time and in the same manner as existing sales taxes.

California Revenue and Taxation Code Section 7285.9 authorizes the City to levy or increase a transactions and use tax (i.e. “sales tax") at a rate of .25 percent or multiple thereof, for the general purposes of the city, if the ordinance proposing the tax is approved by a majority of the qualified voters of the city voting in an election on that issue. If approved by the voters, the sales tax will become operative no sooner than October 1,2008.	

The revenues from this tax are not designated for any specific purpose. The revenues may be used for general city functions, such as police protection including anti-gang programs, fire suppression services, code enforcement and other general services.
