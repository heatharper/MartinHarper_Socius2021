CITY ATTORNEYâ€™S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE F

The proposed measure, if approved, would authorize the City to increase the transient
occupancy tax rate by 4% to provide funding for the potential expansion of the San
Jose McEnery Convention Center and safety and security improvements to the
Center.

The transient occupancy tax (commonly referred to as the hotel tax) is paid only by
guests at hotels, motels and other similar structures designed or used for tourist
lodging in the City of San Jose. The current hotel tax rate is 10% of the rent charged
to the hotel guest. This measure would authorize the City Council to amend the San
Jose Municipal Code in order to increase the hotel tax rate by an additional 4%. If
approved, the total tax rate would be 14%. The proceeds of the 4% rate increase
would be deposited into a special fund and could only be used to fund the potential
expansion of the Convention Center and security and safety improvements to the
Center. A Citizens Oversight Committee would be appointed to oversee use of the
monies and the City would be required to provide annual financial audits of
expenditures in the fund.

A yes vote would allow the City to increase the transient occupancy tax rate by 4% for
the special purpose of funding the future expansion of the San Jose McEnery
Convention Center and security and safety improvements to the Center.

A no vote would not allow the transient occupancy tax rate to be increased.
