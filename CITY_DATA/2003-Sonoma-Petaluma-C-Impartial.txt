

CITY ATTORNEYâ€™S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS
OF MEASURE C

The Petaluma City Council has placed Measure C on the November 4,2003 ballot
asking voters to amend the Petaluma City Charter to permit the adoption of a
special utility users tax.

Section 63.5 of the Charter currently prohibits the City Council or its staff from
levying, imposing or collecting a tax upon the use in the City by any residential
user, business user or any other user of telephone, communication services
whether intrastate or interstate, electrical energy, gas, water, garbage, cable
television or any other use of utilities by residents of Petaluma.

Measure C, if passed by the voters would amend Section 63.5 of the Charter to
provide an exception and allow for the levying and collection by the City Council of
a tax upon the use of electricity and gas in the City of Petaluma by any residential
user, business user, industrial user or any other user. Such tax would be limited to
no more than twenty (20) years and could not exceed 5% of each monthly charge
for the electric or gas service. The revenue from such tax would be used only for
curb-to-curb repair and reconstruction of existing City streets and not for the
construction of new streets.

Even if Measure C passes, any such tax could not be levied or collected unless
the voters vote to impose such a tax through a separate ballot measure. The
City Council has placed a separate companion measure, Measure D, on the
November 4, 2003 ballot, seeking voter approval for the actual imposition of the
utility users tax.

Measure C would only become effective if approved by a majority of the voters
voting on the November 4,2003 election.
