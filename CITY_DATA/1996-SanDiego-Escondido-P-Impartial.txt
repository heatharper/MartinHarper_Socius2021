CITY ATTORNEYâ€™S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS

In 1986, California voters passed Proposition 62, which required, among other things, that all
general taxes be approved by a majority vote of the people. However, Proposition 62 was
invalidated by the lower courts of California. The California Supreme Court declined to overrule
these lower court decisions. As a result, many taxes were approved throughout California without
a vote of the people, on the assumption that the decision of the lower courts was final and
Proposition 62 was invalid.

In 1993, the Escondido city council passed Ordinance 93-35, which raised the rate of transient
occupancy tax from 8% to 10%. The transient occupancy tax is imposed on persons who rent
motel rooms in the city. Proceeds go into the general fund of the city and are used for general city
purposes

In 1995, the California Supreme Court issued an opinion in the case of Santa Clara County
Transportation Authority v. Guardino, 45 Cal. Rptr. 2d 207 holding that Proposition 62 was a valid
proposition and that general taxes must be approved by a majority vote of the people.

At this point in time, it is not clear whether the decision in Santa Clara County Transportation
Authority v. Guardino is retroactive. However, this measure satisfies the obligation of Proposition
62 by submitting the increased transient occupancy tax to the voters for approval.
