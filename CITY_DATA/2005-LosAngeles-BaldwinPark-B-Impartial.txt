The City of Baldwin Park currently imposes a tax upon every person who
occupies a hotel room within the City (unless the person is exempt from tax
under the law). The tax rate is ten percent (10%) of the rental rate for the hotel
room. The tax is collected by the operator of the hotel and sent to the City, which
then may use the revenue for any general municipal purpose. This is referred to
as a transient occupancy tax. This measure will raise the rate of the transient
occupancy tax to eleven percent (11%) on January 1, 2006, and then to twelve
percent (12%) on January 1, 2008. The additional revenue raised may also be
spent for any general municipal purpose.
