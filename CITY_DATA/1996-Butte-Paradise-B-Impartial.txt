TOWN ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS
MEASURE B

On December 5, 1995, the Town Council of the Town of
Paradise (“Town Council”) adopted Ordinance No. 263
relating to the enactment of a utility users tax. A yes
vote on this measure by a majority of the electors voting
is necessary for the ordinance to become effective.

Ordinance No. 263 authorizes the Town Council to
establish by resolution a new utility users tax of no more
than three percent (3%) upon the charges to the users
of the following utilities:

•	Intrastate telephone services

•	Electrical energy

•	Gas

• Cable television

Utility companies providing taxable services under the
ordinance are required to collect the tax at the same
time as the regular billing charges for services. If a utility
user does not pay the tax when it is due, a twenty five
percent (25%) penalty will be added to the unpaid
amount, but not less than $15.00. A second twenty five
percent (25%) or $15.00 penalty will be assessed if the
amount owed is not paid within 30 days after the original
delinquency date.

Depending on the rate of the utility tax imposed by Town
Council resolution, the amount of annual tax revenue
generated by the tax is estimated to be $212,010 at one
percent (1%), $424,020 at two percent (2%) and
$636,030 at three (3%), All revenues generated by the
tax are to be deposited in the Town’s general fund and
may be allocated for general municipal purposes.

The ordinance requires the Town Council to place a ballot measure on the Primary Election for year 2000 to
continue the utility user tax. If the ballot measure fails to
receive a majority vote of those voting in the 2000
Primary Election, the utility users tax would terminate.
