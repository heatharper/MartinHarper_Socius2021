CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS
OF PROPOSITION 97-C

(Transient Occupancy Tax)

The Transient Occupancy or Hotel Tax is a tax on a
person for the occupancy of any hotel or motel room which
occurs in the City of Inglewood. It is commonly referred to
as a "visitor oriented" tax since the burden of the tax falls
on the occupant of the hotel or motel room, often a visitor
to the City. The tax has been in effect since 1973.

In September 1996, the City Council increased the
tax from 10% of the room rate to 12%. The increase was
not intended to go into effect until July 1, 1997 and is
expected to result in an increase in revenues of $200, 000
annually.

In November 1996, the voters of the State of
California amended the Constitution by adding Article
XI11C §2 (c), which requires that any taxes increased
between January 1, 1995 and November 6, 1996 be
approved by a majority of the voters before it can continue
to be imposed. The Transient Occupancy Tax increase
adopted by the City Council in September 1996 is
therefore required to obtain voter approval.

This measure seeks to obtain voter approval of the
increased Transient Occupancy Tax in order to comply
with the new provisions of the California Constitution.
