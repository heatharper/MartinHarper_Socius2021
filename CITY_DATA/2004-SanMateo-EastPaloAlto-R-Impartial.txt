IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE R

This measure, if adopted by a simple majority of voters voting on the
measure, would accomplish the following:

•	This measure would create a new classification for ‘Hazardous
Waste Disposal Facilities’ and require such facilities to pay a
business license tax of 10% of gross receipts; and

•	This measure would apply to a business which treats, stores,
recycles or disposes of hazardous waste at a facility in
East Palo Alto.

Hazardous waste disposal facilities are currently classified as
manufacturing or processing enterprises, under the City’s business license
tax regulations, paying $1.00 for every $1,000 of gross receipts up to
$10 million and $.50 for every $1,000 over $10 million. Approximately
11 businesses in East Palo Alto are classified as manufacturers or
processors.

At the present time only one business would be affected by this
measure, but it would apply to any similar business or facility permitted to
dispose of hazardous waste.

The revenue from this measure would go into the City’s General Fund,
which means such revenue could be used for any municipal purpose, as
determined by the city council, such as public safety or law enforcement,
parks, recreation, streets, administration and the like.

An administrative appeal procedure is available to challenge the tax
determined in any particular case.

If adopted, this measure would go into effect immediately.
