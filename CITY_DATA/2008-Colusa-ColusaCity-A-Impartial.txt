CITY OF COLUSA

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF CITY MEASURE A

The Colusa City Council has placed Measure A on the
November 4,2008 ballot asking voters to adopt Ordinance
No. 439 imposing a transaction and use tax of 0.25% (one
quarter of one percent). This would be the equivalent of
a quarter of a cent tax on an item that costs a dollar, or
twenty-five cents on an item that costs $100. A copy of
Ordinance No. 439 is provided in the sample ballot.

The current tax rate in the City of Colusa is 7.25%. Of the
7.25% tax rate, 6% goes to the State, and 1.25% goes
to fund County and City operations. The transaction and
use tax, like a sales and use tax, would be levied on the
sale or use of tangible personal property sold at retail.
Accordingly, if voters approve Measure A the total tax rate
for most purchases in the City would increase to 7.50%.

This tax is a “general tax” rather than a “special tax.”
The revenue generated from the proposed tax would
be deposited into the general fund, and the proceeds
would be used for any lawful municipal purpose within the
discretion of the City Council.

A “yes” vote is a vote to adopt Measure A allowing the City
of Colusa to levy a transaction and use tax at the rate of

0.25%. A “no” vote is a vote against adopting Measure A
and against the tax.

Voter approval of Measure A is required by the California
Constitution. Measure A requires a “yes” vote by a majority
of the voters in order to become effective.
