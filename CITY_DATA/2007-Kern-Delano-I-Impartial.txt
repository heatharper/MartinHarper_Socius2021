IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
CITY OF DELANO
MEASURE I

TEMPORARY TRANSACTIONS AND USE TAX
TEMPORARY (TEN-YEAR) ONE PERCENT SALES TAX INCREASE

The ballot measure, if adopted by the voters, would enact a temporary ten-year
one-percent (1%) increase to the sales tax rate in the City of Delano. The sales
tax also referred to as a “transactions and use tax." The current sales tax rate in
the City of Delano is seven and one-quarter percent (7.25%). Accordingly, if this
ballot measure Is adopted, the sales tax rate would increase to eight and
one-quarter percent (8.25%) for the next ten years. The proposed increased
sales tax like the current sales tax, would be imposed upon the sale of all tangible
personal property sold at retail within the jurisdictional limits of the City as well as upon the storage, use or other consumption of tangible personal property purchased from any retailer in the jurisdictional limits of the City.

All revenue generated from the proposed sales tax increase would become part
of the City's General Fund which funds, among other things, police and fire services, road repairs, park and recreation programs and other City services and departments. As such, this ballot measure proposes a “general purpose tax” rather
than a “special purpose tax” and only requires a majority vote for adoption.
