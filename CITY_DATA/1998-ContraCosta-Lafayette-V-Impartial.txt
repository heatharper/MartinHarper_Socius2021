CITY ATTORNEYâ€™S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF THE
LAFAYETTE SPECIAL THREE-YEAR PARCEL TAX FOR
POLICE PATROL SERVICES MEASURE V

This measure, if approved, would authorize the City to levy a special parcel tax for each of three
fiscal years, beginning with fiscal year 1999-2000 and extending through the fiscal year 2001-2002. For
each of these years, which run from July 1 through June 30, the City Council of the City of Lafayette would
determine the amount of the parcel tax to be levied and collected. The parcel tax may be less than $92.00
for each parcel in each fiscal year, but may not exceed that amount.

The parcel tax would be levied and collected at the same time and in the same manner as real property taxes.

The proceeds from this special parcel tax may only be used to increase police patrol services and for
no other purpose. During the three years that the parcel tax is levied, the City is required to maintain the
same level of expenditures for police services that existed during the fiscal year 1998-1999. The existing
level of expenditures for police services during fiscal year 1998-1999 is $1.9 million. During the three-year
period in which the parcel tax is imposed, the City Council must maintain, at a minimum, this same level
of funding for police services from its general revenue sources. This assures that the proceeds of the parcel
tax are committed solely for the purpose of increasing patrol services and that the parcel tax is not used to
reduce the funding level for existing police services.

The measure also requires that, during the three-year period that the parcel tax is levied, the City must
develop long-term options for providing for public safety in the City of Lafayette.
