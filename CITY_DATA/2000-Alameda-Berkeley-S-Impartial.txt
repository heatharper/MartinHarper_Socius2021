Currently, almost all maintenance of parks, city trees and landscaping in the
City of Berkeley is funded by a citywide special tax of 8.110 per square foot on
all improvements to real property in the City of Berkeley. This ordinance would
increase that tax rate to 8.900 per square foot, to pay for an increased level of
maintenance on existing facilities as well as allowing for the maintenance of
several planned improvements in city parks, medians and open spaces. When •
the ordinance was adopted in 1997, the rate was 7.240 per square foot plus
annual adjustments for changes in the cost of living. Since that time, the cost of
living has increased by approximately 12%, resulting in the current rate of
8.110. The tax will continue to be indexed to the cost of living in the immediate San Francisco Bay Area.

Financial Implications

This ordinance would increase the current special tax rate of 8.110 per square
foot on all improvements to real property in the City of Berkeley to 8.900 per
square foot. Currently the tax raises approximately $6,250,000 per year for the
maintenance of parks, medians, open space and city trees. If approved, this ordinance would adjust the rate upward by approximately 9.7% and thereby raise
an additional $600,000 per year for these services. The City has approved over
$12,000,000 in planned capital improvements or acquisitions, which will
expand open space and recreational opportunities in the next two years throughout Berkeley. Funding for the ongoing maintenance of these expanded services
has not yet been identified, but may result in cuts to existing park maintenance
services or other General Fund programs to free up the necessary revenue if this
tax is not approved. The rate adjustment will not become effective until the tax
bill due November 2001.

It is estimated that the tax will cost the following average amounts during fiscal
year 2001-02.

Square Feet	Additional Tax	Total Annual Tax
1,200	$ 9.48	$106.80
1,500	$11.85	$133.50
1,900	$15.01	$169.10
3,000	$23.70	$267.00
10,000	$79.00	$890.00
