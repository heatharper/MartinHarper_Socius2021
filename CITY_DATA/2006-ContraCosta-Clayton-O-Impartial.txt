Impartial Analysis from County Counsel

Following advertised public hearing on June 20, 2006, the City Council adopted Resolution No. 23-2006 establishing the Clayton Community Facilities District 2006-1 (CFD), the boundaries of which encompass the entire City of Clayton. The purpose of the CFD is to pay for the operation and maintenance of a citizen-designed public park in the Downtown on City-owned property. The types of public services proposed to be provided by the CFD are itemized in Exhibit "A" to the Resolution. They include the operation, maintenance, repair and replacement of depreciated assets for the Downtown Park and its related facilities, equipment and improvements.
In order to pay for these costs and related expenses a special tax is proposed to be levied annually in the following amounts:
	A.  Residential Parcels: - $16.39 per parcel.
	B.  Downtown Core Parcels: - $221.05 per 1/4 acre or fraction thereof.
	C.  Other Commercial Parcels: Outside Downtown Core - $96.92 per 1/4 acre or fraction 	thereof.
	D.  Recreational Open Space Parcels (Private Golf Course): - $48.46 per 1/4 acre or 	fraction thereof.
	E.  Multi-Family Residential Care Facilities Parcels: - $ 50.92 per 1/4 acre or fraction thereof.
Further details regarding the above tax rates are set forth in Exhibit "B" to Resolution 23-2006. Each special tax rate may be increased annually by the City Council in an amount not to exceed the most recent full annual adjustment (April to April of the Consumer Price Index-All Urban Consumers (CPI), San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose, California area, base period 1982-84 equals 100). The determination to apply any CPI adjustment is made by the City Council at a public meeting. The annual increase may not exceed 3% over the previous year's rate and each rate could not be considered for an increase until Fiscal Year 2008-2009.
The special tax will be levied annually for a period of 10 years commencing with fiscal year 2007-2008 to and including fiscal year 2016-2017 and then will expire.
Resolution No. 24-2006 was adopted by the City Council on June 20, 2006 proposing an annual appropriations limit of $100,600.00 (first year budget). The Resolution also called for a special election to be held on November 7, 2006 to determine whether the special tax shall be levied, and if the appropriations limit for the District (first year budget) shall be as stated above.
Passage of the special tax requires a favorable vote of two-thirds of the votes cast on the measure.
