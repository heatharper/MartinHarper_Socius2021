IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY CITY OF SEASIDE ORDINANCE 910, A CITIZEN-PROPOSED INITIATIVE ENTITLED "AN ORDINANCE AMENDING THE SEASIDE MUNICIPAL CODE REDUCING THE CITY’S EXISTING 6% UTILITY USER TAX TO 4% ON JANUARY 1,2003, AND TO 3% ON JANUARY 1,2004” MEASURES  

The initiative measure proposes to amend the City of Seaside's Municipal Code Chapter 3.30 entitled "Utility Tax Law of the City" so that it will limit the tax rate imposed under Chapter 3.30 to an amount not to exceed 4% effective January 1, 2003, and to then further reduce the tax rate to an amount not to exceed 3% effective January 1,2004.  Chapter 3.30 currently places a utility user tax on persons who receive and pay for electricity, gas, telephone, water and cable television service within the City. The tax is a percentage of the charges for these utilities and is currently assessed at the rate of 6%. Revenue from the tax is currently used for the general governmental purposes of the City of Seaside.  If this measure is approved by voters, the tax will be reduced from its current level of 6% to an amount not to exceed 4% effective January 1, 2003, and then to an amount not to exceed 3% effective January 1, 2004. Approval of the measure will result in reducing the amount of revenue available to the City in its current use for general government purposes, and will prohibit the City Council from increasing the tax beyond 4% effective January 1, 2003, and beyond 3% effective January 1, 2004, unless and until another action is approved by the voters. Adoption of this Ordinance Amendment also retains the current utility tax user exemptions as set forth in Seaside Municipal Code Section 3.30.210 which apply to exemptions for persons sixty-five years of age or older or persons with a qualified disability.
