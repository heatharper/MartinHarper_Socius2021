CITY ATTORNEY IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS

EXISTING LAW:	The	City	of	Del	Mar	currently imposes, for the privilege of occupancy in any

hotel, a transient occupancy tax on any hotel guest who rents a unit in a hotel for 30 days or less
at the current rate of 11.5% of the rent charged by the hotel operator. Under existing law, any
such rental in any structure or portion of any structure which has three or more units is subject to
this tax. The term "hotel" is defined to include hotel, inn, tourist home or house, motel, studio
hotel, bachelor hotel, lodging house, rooming house, apartment house, dormitory, public or
private club, mobile home or house trailer at a fixed location or other similar structure or portion
thereof.

EFFECT OF MEASURE ON EXISTING LAW:	If	a majority of the votes cast on this measure

are "yes‚Äù, then commencing ten (10) days after the vote is declared by the City Council, existing
law would be amended to apply the application of the transient occupancy tax regardless of the
number of units in a structure and to expressly include short term rental units (for 30 days or less)
in the definition of the term "hotel". Consequently, any guest of a hotel (as defined), regardless of
the number of units contained in the structure, along with the short term rentals, would be
required to pay the transient occupancy tax which is currently at a rate of 11.5% of the rent
charged.

FISCAL IMPACT:	Undetermined.	The	tax	is	a	general tax and revenues derived are for the

benefit of the City's general fund. The amount of the tax revenue that will result from the
proposed tax cannot be determined in advance of knowing the amount of rents received by
operators of short term rentals.
