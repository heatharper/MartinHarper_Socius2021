TOWN OF FAIRFAX
SPECIAL TAX FOR PARAMEDIC SERVICES
IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY TOWN ATTORNEY
MEASURED

If this measure is approved by a 2/3 vote, the special tax for paramedic
services-administered by a Joint Powers Authority originally authorized
by the voters on June 7, 1983, and reconfirmed by the voters on
November 6,1998, will be continued with a maximum annual levy of $30
on each living unit and $30.00 per 1,500 square feet of structure on each
developed parcel in non-residential use. By approval of this Measure the
appropriations limit established for the Town of Fairfax pursuant to
Article XIII B of the California Constitution will be increased in an amount
equal to the proceeds of the special tax. The special tax and
corresponding increase in appropriations limit will expire on June 30,
2007.
