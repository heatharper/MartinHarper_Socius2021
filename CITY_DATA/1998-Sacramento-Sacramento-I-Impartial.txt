IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE I

PREPARED BY THE CITY ATTORNEY

Effect of Measure on Existing Law

The City of Sacramento has been collecting in-lieu property tax and franchise fees from ;
City-operated utility enterprises: water, sewer, storm drainage and solid waste (garbage).
These fees, totaling approximately $10.5 million in 1997-1998, are deposited into the City’s General Fund, and are used to fund police, fire, parks, recreation, and other city services.

If this measure is approved, it would substitute a voter-approved general tax on the utility enterprises for the in-lieu property tax and franchise fees. The amount of the general tax to be paid by the utility enterprises to the General Fund would be equal to the amount of the in-lieu fees for which it would substitute, and would not change existing utility rates. 

Operation of Measure	

Measure I would:	

•	Impose a general tax, at the rate of 11 % of user fees and charges received, on four City-operated utility enterprises: water, sewer, storm drainage and solid waste. 

•	Permit the general tax rate on these enterprises to vary, so long as the total tax paid by all of the enterprises does not exceed 11 % of their total taxable gross revenues. 

•	Direct that the tax proceeds be deposited into the City General Fund, which funds police, fire, parks, recreation, and other City services.	

•	Reaffirm that utility rates shall not exceed the costs incurred by the City to provide the services.	

Fiscal Impact	

Approval of the measure would have no fiscal impact. The tax proceeds received by the General Fund would be equal to the property tax and franchise fees that would no longer be paid to the General Fund.

Approval of the measure would not change existing city utility rates.
