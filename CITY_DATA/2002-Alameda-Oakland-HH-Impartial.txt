Summary Prepared by The City Attorney
This measure would authorize the City of Oakland to impose a 1/2% surcharge for five years to the City's Alternate Fuel (coal, charcoal or any other combustible material), Cable, Gas, Electricity and Telephone Utility Users Tax Rate. The tax is imposed on the amount paid by Oakland residents and businesses for alternate fuel, cable, gas, electric and telephone services.
The current tax rate is seven and one-half percent (7.5%). The surcharge would increase the amount of tax paid to eight percent (8%) for a five-year period. Excepted from the proposed electricity and gas surcharges are persons qualifying for the low-income rate assistance program (LIRA) offered by the Pacific Gas & Electric Corporation ("PG&E").
The City may expend revenue it receives from the surcharge for any general fund purpose.
This measure also clarifies that the telephone users tax rate applies to all communications regardless of the origination or termination of the call, and regardless of whether the call is included within a "package" or is billed as a separately listed call.
