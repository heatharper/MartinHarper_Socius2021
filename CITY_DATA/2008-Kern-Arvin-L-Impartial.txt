IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY	
CITY OF ARVIN MEASURE L	


Pursuant to the Bradley-Burns Uniform Local Sales and Use Tax Law, California goverment code § 7200 et seq., city councils may vote to approve a measure to increase the sales tax by one percent, and place that measure on the ballot. If approved by a majority of the voters, this proposed measure (the “Arvin Vital City Services Measure”), authorizes a one percent sales tax increase within the City of Arvin.	

The proposed tax would be paid in addition to current sales taxes. It would be collected at the same time and in the same manner as existing sales taxes. The proposed tax would be imposed upon the sale of all tangible personal property sold at retail within the jurisdictional limits of the City as well as upon the storage, use, or other consumption of tangible personal property purchased from any retailer in jurisdictional limits of the City. Certain transactions, as described in Section 18.110 of the measure, would be exempted from the tax. The measure requires annual financial audits and allows public review of expenditures. The resulting tax will be a general tax as provided under Article XIIIC of the California Constitution and available for general city uses and purposes. As a general tax, it requires a majority vote for adoption.  

A “yes” vote is a vote to adopt the one percent sales tax increase.  A “no” vote is a vote not to establish such a tax, which will result in the City not obtaining the revenue that this tax would provide.
