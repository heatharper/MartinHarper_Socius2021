CITY ATTORNEYâ€™S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE M

This ordinance would authorize a supplemental real property transfer special
tax of 0.5% of the sales price of all transfers of real property in Berkeley. The
current real property transfer tax is 1.5% of sales price. One-half of the proceeds
of the special tax would be allocated to the Housing Trust Fund for housing that
will be permanently affordable and provided only to people who live or work in
Berkeley. 20% of the proceeds of the tax would be allocated to temporary emergency assistance to prevent homelessness. 30% of the proceeds of the tax would
be allocated to a Housing Safety Program that would include, but not be limit-
ed to, programs to reduce the danger from earthquakes and other major hazardous conditions primarily in multi-unit residential buildings, and programs to
reduce financial hardship and prevent displacement of very low income people
as a result of the Program. The Council would be permitted to increase or
decrease these percentage allocations by up to 10% of the proceeds of the tax.
The tax would not apply to purchases of owner-occupied one-unit properties
priced at no more than $350,000 or being sold for no more than 105% of their
previous sales price. No more than 15% of all amounts collected pursuant to the
tax could be spent on City administrative, technical assistance and outreach
costs. The tax would be subject to same exemptions as the existing transfer tax.
Financial Implications

This special tax would be imposed upon all transfers of real property, and would
add 0.5% to the amount of the existing transfer tax, which is 1.5% of the sales
price. The additional transfer tax would cost $500 for every 100,000 in sales
price of property. Owner-occupied single family homes that sell for no more
than $350,000 or no more than 105% of their previous sales price would be
exempt from this special tax.
