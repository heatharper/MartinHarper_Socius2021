CITY ATTORNEY IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS

The City of Del Mar currently imposes a ten and gpe-half percent transient occupancy tax which
was approved by the voters in 2002. The transient occupancy tax is imposed only on hotel
visitors who visit the City of Del Mar for thirty days or less. The tax is collected by the hotel
operator based on the room rent paid by visitors and transmitted to the City. The City's transient
occupancy tax is a general tax and, in accordance with California law, the tax rate may not be
increased unless approved by a majority of the voters in the City of Del Mar. On July 21, 2008,
the City Council adopted a resolution submitting to the voters an ordinance amending subsection
(A) of Chapter 3.12.010 that would permit the City to increase the TOT rate up to thirteen
percent.

Proposition H is the ordinance that was approved by the City Council on July 21, 2008. If
approved by the voters, Proposition H would amend Del Mar Municipal Code section 3.12.010
(A) to allow the City to increase the transient occupancy tax rate by no more than two and one
half percent for a total transient occupancy tax rate of up to thirteen percent. Revenue collected
from the transient occupancy tax is deposited into the City's general fund to pay for general
governmental services such as fire protection, parks, police protection, and other community
services.

If Proposition H is approved by the voters, the City Council could, depending on the totality of
circumstances, adopt a resolution increasing the TOT up to 2.5% for a maximum TOT of 13%. If
a majority of the voters vote "no" on this Proposition, then the City's transient occupancy tax rate
will remain at ten and one-half percent.
