CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS
THREE-QUARTER CENT SALES TAX
INCREASE FOR PUBLIC SERVICES -
CITY OF GUSTINE MEASURE N

Measure N would raise the revenue for the City of
Gustine by authorizing a three-quarter percent transaction and use tax (commonly referred to as a “sales tax”)
within the City of Gustine. The three-quarter percent tax
would be paid in addition to current sales taxes. If
approved by a majority of voters the tax would go in to
effect April 1,2009.

Measure N provides that the sales tax is to be
used for “the general governmental purposes of the City
and be received into the general fund of the City”.
Because the sales tax would be a general tax, it could
be used for any legal municipal purpose. The City
would not be legally bound to use the tax monies for
any special purpose or for any particular services, facilities or programs.

Measure N requires the City’s independent auditors to complete an annual Transactions and Use Tax
Ordinance Compliance and Internal Control Audit
Report. Their report must review whether the Sales tax
revenues collected by the City are collected, managed

and expended in accordance with the requirements of
the applicable law.

Measure N would make Gustine Ordinance 444
operative. The ordinance, which has also been
reviewed by the State Board of Equalization, is the legal
instrument that authorizes the additional sales tax, but
only if a majority of the voters at the November 4, 2008
election vote for this measure. The ordinance was
adopted by the Gustine City Council on September 16,
2008 and a copy of it is printed as part of these ballot
materials.
