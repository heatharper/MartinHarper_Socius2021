IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE HH

This measure will establish a special tax to obtain, furnish, operate
and maintain police protection equipment and the payment of
salaries and benefits for police protection personnel. The special tax
is to be levied on each parcel of land within the city limits of the City
of Coachella for three (3) years only.

The amount of the special tax is fixed: and it cannot increase during
the three (3) year period. For example, the special tax on a single
family residence is sixty dollars (S60) per year or 16.4 cents per
day.

The special tax will be levied for the three fiscal years of 1994-95,
1995-96 and 1996-97. But, the collection of the special tax will be
delayed for one (1) year so that the first installment will not be
payable until December 1995.

The special tax is projected to generate $475,000.00 per fiscal year
which can only be used for police protection equipment and serv-
ices. The tax is needed because the Cityâ€™s general fund which
supports police protection services is insufficient to maintain the
current level of police protection services for the City of Coachella.

The City Council of the City of Coachella has proposed the adoption
of this Measure to the voters of the City of Coachella under the
authority of Government Code Sections 50075 and 53978. For this
purpose, the City Council has called an election to submit this
Measure to the voters within the City of Coachella for adoption. If
two thirds (2/3) of the voters voting on this Measure approve it, the
special tax will be charged only for the three fiscal years of 1994-95,
1995-96 and 1996-97.

A "YES" vote on Measure HH will adopt the special tax for police
protection.

A 'NO' vote on Measure HH will defeat the special tax for police
protection.
