IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE “H”

Measure “H” would impose a three percent (3%) admissions tax. The tax
paid by a patron is a percentage of the admission charged. For example,
a $20 ticket would pay a tax of 60 cents (3 x $20 = 60) After 2003, the
measure authorizes the City Council to lower the tax rate or to increase it
to a maximum of five percent (5%). Prior to increasing the tax rate, the
City Council is required to give event operators an opportunity to be
heard on any proposed increase.

The tax would be paid by any person who pays an admission charge to
participate as a spectator to any entertainment, amusement or recreational activity in the City of Indian Wells. Typical events that will be taxed
include sporting contests, athletic events, exhibitions, concerts, lecturers, theatrical and musical performances, fairs, and festivals if an admission is charged. The ordinance exempts events held by non-profit
organizations. Thus, the tax would not apply to events held by a nonprofit
country dub, social club or tennis club. Nor would it apply to events held
by schools or governmental entities. The tax would not be applied to
complimentary tickets or event sponsors.

The City Council is authorized to adopt regulations to implement the
ordinance or to amend portions of the ordinance. The Council can not
increase the maximum five percent (5%) tax rate nor can it amend the
exemptions.

The tax revenues received from the tax can be used for any municipal
purpose. The measure will take effect only if it is approved by a majority of the Indian Wells electors voting on the measure.
