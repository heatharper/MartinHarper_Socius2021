The California Constitution authorizes an increase in taxes if approved
by the electorate. A general tax requires a majority vote and is imposed for
general governmental purposes, such as, but not limited to: fire, general
administrative, library, parks and recreation, and police services.

The City of San Bruno proposes to repeal existing Municipal Code
Chapter 3.16 setting forth the current schedule of business license taxes and
adopt a new Chapter 3.16 providing for an amended schedule of increased
business license taxes.

Business license taxes are imposed upon every person transacting, engaging in, or carrying on a business within the City of San Bruno, except for
businesses excepted or exempted from such taxes under local, state or federal
law. Business license taxes are levied in several different ways, including:
based upon a percentage of a business’ gross receipts, square footage of the
place of business, or the particular business activity conducted.

The dollar amounts of the minimum taxes in the City of San Bruno’s
schedule of business license taxes have not increased since 1947. Most businesses will see their taxes increase under this ordinance. A new category of
commercial property business will be established and a tax imposed. Businesses may or may not pass these additional costs on to customers.

In fiscal year 1998-1999, business license taxes (excluding gambling
club table taxes) contributed $580,000, or 3%, to the City’s general fund.
The new schedule of business license taxes is expected to increase by
$170,000 monies collected to $750,000 for fiscal year 2000-01.

If the measure is approved, the City of San Bruno Municipal Code will
be amended and the new schedule of business license taxes will be effective
January 1, 2000.
