MEASURE GG
CITY OF HUNTINGTON BEACH
ADVISORY VOTE ONLY

The question of establishing a citywide assessment district is advisory only. The vote has no legal effect and is not binding. It is
merely to help the City of Huntington Beach gauge public support
for the concept being voted upon. The City Council may take whatever action it desires, or no action, regardless of the vote. Should it
take action, it is not limited to the question as presented, and it may
alter anything therein if it chooses to do so.
