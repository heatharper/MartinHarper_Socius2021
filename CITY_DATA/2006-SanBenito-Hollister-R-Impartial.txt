CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE R  


A Yes vote on Measure R will approve the adoption of an Ordinance imposing a one percent (1%) transactions and use tax (“sales tax”) on all retailers doing business in the City of Hollister. The proposed increase would be imposed in the same manner as the existing sales tax, upon the sale of tangible personal property sold at retail within the City limits and upon the storage, use, or other consumption of tangible personal property purchased from any retailer in I the City limits. The tax would be collected and administered by the State Board of Equalization.  The proposed sales tax is a general tax rather than a “special I purpose tax.” Revenues from the proposed sales tax would be deposited into the City’s general fund and available for use by the City to pay for general City operations and services, such as police, fire, parks, recreation programs and street improvements.  The proposed tax would increase the local sales tax rate in Hollister from the current 7.25% to 8.25%. If approved, the City’s portion of the safes tax would increase from 0.75% to 175%.  The City estimates that the one percent (1%) sales tax will generate approximately $4 million in revenue each year. If approved by the voters, the increased sales tax would take effect on April 1, 2007 (the “Operative Date").  The City’s authority to levy the sales tax would automatically terminate five (5) years from its Operative Date. Measure R provides for the appointment of a citizen’s oversight committee which will annually review and report on revenues and disbursements and hold a public hearing.  To become law, Measure R must be approved by a majority of vote of the qualified voters.
