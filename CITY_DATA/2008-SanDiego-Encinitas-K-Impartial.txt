CITY ATTORNEY IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS

EXISTING LAW: The City of Encinitas currently imposes a special transient occupancy tax on
any hotel guest who rents a unit in a hotel for 30 days or less at a rate of 2% of the rent charged
by the hotel operator. Under existing law, any such rental In any structure or portion of any
structure which has three or more units is subject to this tax The term "hotel" is defined to
include hotel, inn, tourist home or house, motel, studio hotel, bachelor hotel, lodging house,
rooming house, apartment house, dormitory, public or private club, mobile home or house trailer
at a fixed location or other. The tax revenues derived may only be used by the City for beach
sand replenishment and stabilization projects.

EFFECT OF MEASURE ON EXISTING LAW: If two-thirds of the votes casts on this measure are
"yes," then commencing on January 1, 2009, existing law would be amended to apply the
application of a special transient occupancy tax regardless of the number of units in a structure
and to expressly include short term rental units (for 30 days or less) in the definition of the term
"hotel." Consequently, any guest of a hotel (as defined), regardless of the number of units
contained in the structure, along with short term rentals, would be required to pay a special
transient occupancy tax at a rate of 2% of the rent charged for use by the City for beach sand
replenishment and stabilization projects.

FISCAL IMPACT: Undetermined. The amount of tax revenue that will result from the proposed
tax cannot be determined in advance of knowing the amount of rents received by operators of
short term rentals.
