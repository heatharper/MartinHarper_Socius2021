IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE Q-06

The Morro Bay Vital Public Services Restoration and Protection
Measure “Q” proposes to raise revenue for general purposes for the
City of Morro Bay by authorizing a one-half percent (1/2%) transaction
and use tax (commonly referred to as a “sales tax”) within the City of
Morro Bay. The one-half percent tax would be paid in addition to current
sales taxes and would be collected at the same time and in the same
manner as existing sales taxes.

California Revenue and Taxation Code Section 7285.9 authorizes the
City Council to levy a transaction and use tax at a rate of 0.25 percent
or a multiple thereof, provided the tax is approved by a majority of the
voters voting in an election on that issue. The proposed tax will increase
the local sales tax rate in Morro Bay from the current 7.25% to 7.75%

The Morro Bay Vital Public Services Restoration and Protection
Measure “Q” states that the one-half (1/2) percent sales tax is to be
used for City services such as “fire, paramedics, street and pothole
repairs, storm drains, police, youth and park programs and other
general community services”. Because this sales tax would be a
“general tax,” the tax would go into the City’s general fund and could be
used for any legal municipal purpose.

Measure “Q” requires the City Council to appoint a five member Citizen
Oversight Committee to annually review and publicly report upon the
expenditures of the tax revenues to ensure they were made in
accordance with the requirements of the ordinance.
