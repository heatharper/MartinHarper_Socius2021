IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE TT

Pursuant to California Constitution Article XIII C, Section 2(d),
(Proposition 218), effective July 1,1997, Measure TT” proposes to levy
a Special Tax for a six (6) year period commencing fiscal year 1998/99
for wetlands maintenance, lake operations and equipment maintenance,
and start-up funding for water quality services and improvements for Lake
Elsinore according to the following formula:

Tax Category	Annual Tax Rate
Single Family Residential	$10.50
Multiple Family Residential	$ 7.88
Mobile Home Park Residential	$ 5.25
Commercial/Industrial	$42.00 per acre
Vacant Residential	$ 5.25
Vacant Other	$21.00 per acre
Due to fiscal constraints affecting the City, absent a Special Tax, there are limited funds available to finance water quality services and improvements, wetland maintenance, and lake operations and equipment maintenance for Lake Elsinore. Proposition 218 authorizes the City
to levy a Special Tax to pay for these services and improvements if
approved by a 2/3rds vote of those persons voting at the election. It is
estimated that the levied Special Tax will generate approximately
$350,000. All of these funds will be allocated to water quality services
and improvements, wetlands maintenance, and lake operations and
equipment maintenance for Lake Elsinore.

Since this is a Special Tax, in order to be effective, it must be
approved by a 2/3rds vote of those electors voting in this election.
Likewise, the percentage allocations of tax proceeds may be used only
as authorized by the electorate and for no other purpose. After six (6)
years, the Special Tax proposed by Measure “TT" cannot be levied
without approval of 2/3rds of the electors voting in a future election.
