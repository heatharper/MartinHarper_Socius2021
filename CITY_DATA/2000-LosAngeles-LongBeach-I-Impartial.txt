ANALYSIS OF MEASURE I

Voter approval of Measure I would amend provisions of Chapter 3.68 of the Long Beach Municipal Code,
regarding the tax imposed upon users of electricity, gas, telephone and water services within the City (the “utility users
tax”). Presently, the utility users tax is imposed at a rate of ten percent (10%) of the charges made for such services.
Measure I would reduce this tax rate as follows, commencing upon December 1,2000;

Year	Rate
2000	9.5%
2001	9.0%
2002	8.5%
2003	8.0%
2004 and thereafter	7.5%
