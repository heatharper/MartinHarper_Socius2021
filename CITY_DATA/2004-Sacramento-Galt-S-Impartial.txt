

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE S

Prepared by Galt City Attorney

Measure S proposes to raise revenue for general City of Galt purposes by authorizing a 1/4 cent sales tax within the City of Galt. The
tax would be paid in addition to current State and local sales taxes
and would be collected at the same time and in the same manner as
the existing sales taxes.

California Revenue and Taxation Code Section 7285.9 authorizes
the City Council to levy a transactions and use (i.e., a “sales”) tax, if
the tax is approved by a majority of the voters in an election on that
issue. If approved by a majority of the voters, the Measure S sales
tax would become effective April 1, 2005, and would remain in effect
until terminated by vote of the City Council.

Measure S states that the 1/4 cent sales tax is to be used "for general
government purposes.” Because this sales tax would be a “general
tax,” the City would be able to use proceeds from this tax for any legal governmental purpose without restriction. The City would not be
legally bound in any way to use the tax monies for any special purpose or for any particular program or service.
