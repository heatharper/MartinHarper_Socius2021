CITY ATTORNEYâ€™S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF
MEASURE I

Nevada City Fire Department Tax

This measure, if passed, would impose a charge on improved
parcels of property located in Nevada City. That charge would be
$24 per year for single-family residences, $16 per year for each
apartment, condominium or mobile home, and a charge between
$100 - $500 per year on all commercial-type properties such as
industrial, office, professional, retail, hotels and motels, depending
on the size of the building or buildings located on the parcel. It is
anticipated that this would generate nearly $60,000 per year in
revenues to be used by the Fire Department to pay personnel
and/or for capital acquisitions such as fire equipment or other
capital needs of the Department. The City Council of the City of
Nevada City would have final approval over how the funds are
spent on behalf of the Fire Department.

The parcel tax proposed by this measure would be in addition to
the current parcel tax which was approved by the voters on
November 4, 1986. The existing parcel tax is exactly half the rate
that is proposed under this new measure. The current parcel tax
raises approximately $30,000 per year and can only be spent for
Fire Department capital acquisition.
