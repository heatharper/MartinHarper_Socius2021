Measure A proposes to add Article 17 to Chapter 8 of the Hayward Municipal
Code establishing the Library Improvement Fund (Fund). The Fund will be segregated from all other City funds and will be used exclusively for the acquisition, construction, improvement, maintenance and/or operation of the Hayward
City Library System. Potential uses for the Fund shall include, but not be limit-
ed to: restoring services to children and seniors; expansion of the Weekes branch library; building a new Main library; acquiring additional books and
materials; extending weekend and evening hours; and improving joint programs
with local schools. Such Fund may also be used to pay debt service on obligations issued to acquire and/or construct the improvements to the Hayward City
Library System. The measure imposes a special 2% monthly Library
Improvement Tax on the users of Telephone, Gas, Electric, Telecommunications
and Cable utilities. Proceeds from the tax are required to be deposited into the
Library Improvement Fund and may only be used to improve the Hayward City
Library System. Measure A establishes a $20,000 cap adjusted annually for
inflation on the Library Improvement Tax in any one year for any one business
that uses any of the utilities subject to the tax. The tax imposed by this measure
will expire automatically on December 30, 2030, unless it is extended by a vote
of the electorate of the City of Hayward. The Library Improvement Tax is a special tax and will not take effect unless it receives an affirmative vote of 2/3 of
the voters voting on the measure in this election.
