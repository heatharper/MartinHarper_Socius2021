CITY OF MODESTO
MEASURE F

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
Cities and counties have the legal authority to tax persons for the privilege of
occupancy in any hotel. Such taxes are called “Transient Occupancy Taxes” (“TOT”). The
City of Modesto has had a TOT since 1964. Since 1987 the tax rate has been set at nine (9)
percent. As the City’s TOT ordinance is currently written, all TOT proceeds go into the
General Fund, and may be used for any purpose.

This measure would increase the TOT. from nine (9) percent to eleven (11) percent in
two steps over a one year period. If passed, the increased portion only, that is, the additional
two (2) percent, would be placed in a special fund and could be used only for the purpose of
funding a City contribution of $7.5 million to a performing arts center. The increase would
remain in effect indefinitely until the $7.5 million contribution has been made. Under the
proposed measure the tax rate would then automatically revert to nine (9) percent.

The City Council has indicated that if this measure passes, they will also
commit Redevelopment Agency funds (30% of tax increment surplus) to help make the City’s
$7.5 million contribution.

Since the tax increase is to be used for a specified purpose it is a “special tax” under
Proposition 218, and must be approved by a two-thirds (2/3) vote.

You should vote “YES” on this measure if you want to approve a two (2) percent
TOT rate increase for a performing arts center.

You should vote “NO” on this measure if you want to reject the proposed two (2)
percent increase in the TOT
