CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF PROPOSITION L

The ballot measure will provide an advisory vote to the Walnut City Council
concerning a Community Facilities District (CFD)to provide to extend
the hours of the County Library system, which includes the Walnut Library.

The Los Angeles County Library system has lost over 50 percent of its funding
over the past two years and permanently closed ten libraries. On July 1,1994, the
Walnut Library hours were reduced to two days per week. The County Library
has proposed that a CFD be established to provide new funding to re-open the
Walnut Library a total of four days per week.

The CFD charge on the annual property tax is proposed to be $28.50 for each
single-family residential parcel, $21.38 for each multi-family residential unit,
$3.56 per vacant single-family residential parcel, and $24.94 per acre to a
maximum of 5 acres for vacant non-single-family residential parcels with $3.56
minimum charge. For non-residential (commercial and industrial) parcels, the
charge would be based on the median density for single-family residential in Los
Angeles County of 7 Equivalent Dwelling Units (EDUs) per acre; with the charge
calculated as follows: 7 EDUs per acre for the first 5 acres plus .875 EDUs for
each additional acre, multiplied by the benefit factor for type of non-residential
property use. As examples, this would result in a one-half acre supermarket
paying $49.88 per year and a .25-acre service station paying $12.47 per year.

Under existing law, the County may not form a CFD within the boundaries of
a city without the consent of the city. Therefore, it is necessary for the Walnut
City Council to give consent to the County Board of Supervisors for the city’s
inclusion in the CFD.
