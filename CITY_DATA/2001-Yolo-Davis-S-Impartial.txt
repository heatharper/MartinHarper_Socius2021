IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
CITY OF DAVIS
SPECIAL TAX MEASURE S

Measure S, if approved by two-thirds of the voters voting on the measure, will
extend and increase the Park Preservation Tax, a special tax adopted by the voters
in June 1998. Unless extended by the voters, the existing 1998 Park Preservation
Tax will sunset and expire in June 2002. If Measure S is adopted, it will replace
the 1998 Park Preservation Tax beginning July 1, 2001.

Measure S, the extended and increased Park Preservation Tax, as set forth in
Ordinance No. 2048, will provide funding for the maintenance and operation of
parks, street trees, greenbelts, bike paths, medians, public landscaping, urban
wildlife and habitat, swimming pools and recreational facilities. As a special tax,
the tax revenue must be placed in a special fund and can only be used for these
purposes and incidental expenses related to these purposes.

The Park Preservation Tax will continue to be imposed on parcels of property
within the City based on the use of the property. The maximum tax per parcel per
fiscal year (July 1 -June 30) under Measure S will be calculated as follows:

Single-family residential
Multi-family residential
Group Living

Commercial

Industrial

Commercial Day Care Facilities

Vacant Land

$98.00 per unit

$98.00 per unit

$40.00 per resident

$80.00 per 1,000 square feet of

Improved Building Space up to a
maximum of 10,000 square feet
$25.60 per employee up to a maximum
of 30 employees
$28.60 per 1,000 square feet of

Improved Building Space up to a
maximum of 10,000 square feet
$98.00 per Assessorâ€™s Parcel

For fiscal years after 2001-02, the City Council may, but is not required to,
increase the maximum tax rate by the change in the consumer price index but not
to exceed 2 percent (2%) per year.

The tax rates in Measure S are approximately twice the tax rates of the expiring
1998 Park Preservation Tax. The increase is intended to provide funding for the
continued maintenance of existing park facilities and for the new parks, greenbelts
and park facilities that have been constructed since the adoption of the 1998 Park
Preservation Tax, or are planned to be constructed within the next few years.

Measure S includes several exemptions to the tax including an exemption for
public property and the requirement to continue the existing low income exemption.

The Park Preservation Tax would continue to be collected with the ad valorem
property taxes for each parcel, unless that City later decided to collect the tax with
other City taxes and charges.

Measure S would sunset and be repealed on June 30, 2011 and could not be
collected after that time unless two-thirds of the voters voting in an election
approved an extension or reauthorization of the tax.
