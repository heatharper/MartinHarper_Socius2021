IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE C
BY TOWN ATTORNEY

Currently, the Town of Paradise imposes a six percent (6%) transient
occupancy tax on the guests of hotels, motels and like-kind establishments doing
business in the Town.

On November 12, 2003, the Town Council of the Town of Paradise
approved Ordinance No. 406 amending Paradise Municipal Code section 3.24.030 by increasing the amount of the transient occupancy tax from six percent
(6%) to ten percent (10%). The transient occupancy tax is paid only by the guests
of motels, hotels and like-kind establishments within the Town.

According to the Town Finance Director, if this measure is approved by the
voters, it would result in approximately $40,000 of additional revenue to the Town
per year. All revenues generated by the tax increase would be deposited in the
Townâ€™s general fund and would be allocated for general municipal purposes.

A yes vote on this measure by a majority of the voting electors is necessary
for the ordinance to become effective.
