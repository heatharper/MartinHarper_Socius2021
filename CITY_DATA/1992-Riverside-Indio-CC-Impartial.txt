This proposition provides for establishment of a Fire Suppression
Benefit District and the levying of assessments at the maximum rate of
$52.00 per benefit unit. The assessment established shall be
imposed annually beginning in July 1993 and continuing for a period of
five (5) years upon all non-exempt parcels of real property, which are
currently or in the future, located within corporate boundaries of the City
of Indio. Sample assessments for various land uses based on the rate
of $52.00 per year per benefit unit include: vacant parcel = $13.00,
single family residence = $52.00; and mobile home park unit = $39.00.

Funds collected from this benefit assessment shall be expended
only for fire suppression services including expenditures to obtain,
furnish, operate and maintain fire suppression equipment and also
including payment of salaries and benefits for firefighting personnel to
suppress fires, respond to emergencies, and prevent fires. The City
has calculated that the proposed assessment would generate
$793,544.95 per year. By City Council Resolution, the City Council
has pledged to use this additional money to restore eight (8) firefighter
positions at a cost of $487,222.12, restore four (4) police officer
positions at a cost of $236,585.91 and restore one (1) Public Safety
Dispatcher position at a cost of $44,882.60. All costs identified are
annual salary and benefit costs per fiscal year. The $24,854.32 cost
of conducting the election is included in the $793,544.95 total cost.

The City Council of the City of Indio has called for an election for
the purpose of submitting the resolution to the voters within the City of
Indio for approval of establishing a Fire Suppression Benefit District for
a period of five (5) years.

A "yes" vote on Measure CC is a vote to approve the resolution.
