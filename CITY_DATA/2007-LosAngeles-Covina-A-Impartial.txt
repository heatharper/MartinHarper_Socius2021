CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF
MEASURE “A”

UTILITY USERS TAX

Measure A, if approved by a majority vote, would authorize an
amendment to current sections of the City’s Utility Users Tax
Ordinance (Covina Municipal Code, Chapter 3.14) relative to
the following issues:

•	Would extend the life of the City’s Utility Users Tax at its
current rate of 6% by an additional ten (10) years (Tax would
expire on March 16, 2019).

•	Would extensively update the Ordinance’s terms with
respect to “telecommunications services” that are subject
to the Utility Users Tax in the following ways:

•	Provides a modern, functional definition of
“telecommunications services" that is technology-
neutral, and includes the use of Internet protocol (VoIP),
broadband service and private networks for providing
such services;

•	Incorporates definitions of “ancillary telecommunication
services" that are commonly recognized by the industry
as being part of “telecommunication services”;

•	Anticipates the possibility of new technologies and
services to provide telecommunication services, or
changes in Federal law so that all taxpayers will be
treated the same;

•	Anticipates the likelihood that other cities in California will
modernize their utility users tax ordinances, and allows
for a state-wide mechanism that will facilitate uniform
interpretations and administration; and

•	Incorporates other administrative tools for addressing
telecommunication taxation issues including
administrative rulings and sourcing, bundling and nexus
guidelines.

•	Would provide for annual verification that the Utility Users
Tax has been properly collected and that all revenues
have been properly expended through the use of third
party auditors.

The Tax would be computed on the basis of monthly usage
and certain services charges, and would be collected by the
service provider. Measure A would not increase the current
percentage rate of the Tax, but would maintain the rate at
six percent (6%). As a result of updating the definitions or
future changes to Federal law, customers using emerging
technologies for telecommunications services will be subject
to the Tax in the same way as are customers using current
telecommunication technologies.

The Utility Users Tax is a general tax. All revenue generated
by the Tax would go to the City’s General Fund to provide
essential government services including, but not limited to:
police, fire and paramedic, street maintenance, services for
senior citizens, library, and parks and recreation.

This measure must be approved by a majority of the voters.
