TOWN ATTORNEYâ€™S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS
OF MEASURE F

If this measure is approved by a two-thirds vote, the special
tax for paramedic services administered by a Joint Powers
Authority authorized by the voters in 1982, 1986, 1991,
1994, 1998 and 2002 will be continued with a tax of $39
increasing by $3.00 per year not to exceed $48 for each living unit, and in the amount of $39 increasing by $3.00 per
year per 1,500 square feet of structure of each developed
parcel in non-residential use, to be collected in addition to
fees for transport to the hospital charged to insurance
providers, without collection pursued against uninsured
persons. The applicable appropriations limit pursuant to
Article XIIIB of the California Constitution will be
increased in an amount equal to the proceeds of the special
tax. The special tax and the corresponding increase in the
appropriations limit expire on June 30, 2011.
