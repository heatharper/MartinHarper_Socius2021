IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE G

The ballot measure submitted to the voters seeks to extend the cityâ€™s utility user
tax. The utility user tax is a tax on the use of telephone, electricity, natural gas,
water and cable television services in the city. The tax is paid by the consumer as
part of the utility bill.

Measure G limits the amount of the tax to 6%, the same as the existing limit. The
City Council can reduce and adjust the rate of the tax from time to time, but can
never increase the tax above the 6% cap.

The utility user tax is a general tax. General taxes are taxes not limited to a
specific purpose and are used for general city functions, such as police, fire and
library services as well as maintenance of streets and parks.

A yes vote on the proposition authorizes the continued collection of the utility
tax. A no vote will result in the tax no longer being collected after March 31,
2007. The proposition will be adopted if it is approved by a majority of the voters.
