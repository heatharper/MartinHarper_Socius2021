IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS MEASURE L City of Madera Sales Tax For the Preservation of Essential General Governmental Services  This Measure if approved by a majority of the voters enacts a Transaction and Use Tax (sales tax) Ordinance previously approved by the City Council.  The Ordinance imposes a transaction and use tax, commonly referred to as a “sales tax" in the amount of twenty-five cents for every one-hundred dollars of “sales" (.25%).  The net revenue generated by the sales tax may be used for all general governmental purposes. These include but are not limited to police and fire protection, parks and recreation services, code enforcement, street repairs, economic development, elimination of graffiti, land use, streetlights, human resources and administrative services.  The Ordinance implementing the sales tax increase also provides for an independent Citizens Review Committee that will review the revenues generated and the monies expended, and prepare an annual report thereon to be made available for public review.  The sales tax will be collected, administered and distributed by the State Board of Equalization and is estimated to generate approximately $1,128,000.00 annually.  The current sales tax rate in the City of Madera is 7.75%. The State of California and the County of Madera get a majority of those funds. For every one-hundred dollars of sales, the City receives one dollar. If this Measure is passed the City would receive an additional twenty-five cents for every one-hundred dollars in sales. The increase in the sales tax will result in a total sales tax rate in the City of Madera of 8.00%.  The sales tax will be in effect until January 2015.  The sales tax will not go into effect unless the number of votes in favor of the Measure exceeds the number of votes against the Measure.
