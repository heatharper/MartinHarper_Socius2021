Impartial Analysis of Measure A

The City currently imposes a transient occupancy tax upon hotel and motel room stays
by guests in the amount of seven percent (7%) of the applicable rental rate. Measure A
increases the amount of transient occupancy tax from seven percent (7%) to nine
percent (9%) effective January 1, 2010, and to ten percent (10%) effective January 1,
2013. The tax is payable to the hotel/motel operator at the time the rent is paid by the
hotel/motel guest and if paid in installments, a proportionate share of the tax shall be
paid with each installment. The unpaid tax is due upon the guest’s ceasing to occupy
space in the hotel/motel. Any due tax not paid to the hotel/motel operator may be
required to be paid to the City’s tax administrator.

The additional transient occupancy taxes paid would be general taxes, the revenues
from which would be placed into the General Fund of the City, and the City would be
permitted to use the revenues for any valid municipal purpose. This Measure would
take effect only if approved by a majority of those voting on the Measure at the March 3,
2009 General Municipal Election.
