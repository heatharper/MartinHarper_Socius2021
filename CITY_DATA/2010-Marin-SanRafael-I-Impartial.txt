CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF
MEASURE I

This measure would authorize amendment of the San
Rafael Municipal Code to increase the maximum rate of
the City’s existing Paramedic Service Special Tax on residential units and non-residential structures. The total
increase could not exceed $23.00 per unit for residential
units, and $.03 per square-foot for non-residential units.

Currently, the maximum Paramedic Tax rate is $85.00
per unit for residential structures and eleven cents ($.11)
per square-foot for non-residential structures; under exist-
ing law, each year the City Council determines the amount
of the tax to be imposed based upon the costs of the Para-
medic Service for that year, but the tax can in no event
exceed this maximum rate. The paramedic tax will remain
at the current levels should this measure not be approved
by the voters.

This measure, if adopted, would authorize phased increases of the Paramedic Service Special Tax rate from
$85.00 up to a maximum of $108.00 per unit for residential units, and from eleven cents ($.11) per square-foot up
to a maximum of fourteen cents ($. 14) per square-foot for
non-residential structures. This measure would also increase the appropriations limit for the City of San Rafael
for four (4) years (2011/2012 through 2014/2015) by the
total amount collected under this tax so as to enable the
City to expend the money collected, as authorized by Article XIII B of the California Constitution.

If the measure is approved, existing law will continue
to prohibit the City Council from imposing a tax rate in
excess of the approved maximum rates without further
voter approval.

The ordinance amendments proposed by this measure
will be adopted if approved by a two-thirds majority of
those electors voting on the measure.

A YES vote approves the measure.

A NO vote rejects the measure.
