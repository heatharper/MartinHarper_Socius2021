Ordinance No. 359 is a proposal to amend the existing City license tax by
imposing a license fee dealing with transient occupancy of hotels and motels
and generally referred to as the “Transient Occupancy Tax.”

This license fee deals only with “hotels” and “motels” as defined in the
Ordinance, and not to any other business or rental property.

The revenues generated from the taxes created in this proposed Ordinance are
for general revenue purposes and require the approval of the majority of votes
cast at this election.

Generally, this proposed Ordinance provides that after adoption, a tax will be
levied upon, and paid by, the transient. A transient is a person who occupies
a room in a hotel or motel for thirty (30) days or less. The amount of the tax
is ten percent (10%) of the rent charged by the operator of the hotel or motel.
It is a uniform rate. The proposed Ordinance does not change, alter or modify
the regulations and laws dealing with operation of a hotel or motel.

The proposed Ordinance makes provisions for the manner of collection of the
tax, duties of hotel and motel operators with respect to reports, records and
the remittance of funds so collected to the City. Penalties for failure by the
operator to remit the tax collected when due are set forth. A due process hearing
procedure is set forth on issues dealing with the amount due or assessed to the
operator. The City is empowered to take necessary legal action to collect the
tax due. Violation of the Ordinance constitutes a misdemeanor.

Revenues generated by the implementation of this proposed Ordinance will
exceed the costs of administration, if any, to the City of Hawaiian Gardens.

Reference should be made to the text of the proposed Ordinance concerning
any specific aspect of the definitions, procedures and matters considered in the
implementation of this Ordinance.
