Transaction and Use Tax Proposition

Pursuant to Revenue & Taxation Code Section 7285.91, a General Law City such as the City
of Waterford may levy, or increase a transaction use (sales) tax for special purposes at the
rate of one-quarter of a percent, (.025%) or a multiple thereof, subject to approval of the City
Council and by a two-thirds (2/3) majority vote of qualified voters voting on the issue.

On July 7, 2005, the City Council of the City of Waterford unanimously approved the
submittal of the Ordinance to the voters of the City of Waterford providing for the levying of
a transaction/use tax (sales) for special purposes at the rate of one-half percent (0.5%) and
directed that the measure be placed on the November 8, 2005 ballot. The stated special
purposes are increased police services and improvement of existing city streets.

The submitted Ordinance provides that if the increase in sales tax of one-half percent (0.5%)
is approved by a two-thirds (2/3) majority of the qualified voters voting on the issue, the
funds generated by the increase in sales tax available for use by the City will be used one-half (1/2) for increased police services and one-half (1/2) to improve the City streets over the
term of the tax imposed.

Included in the Ordinance are provisions for the payment of necessary expenses from
revenues generated for equipment, training, support and supervisory staff and their
equipment and training, as well as benefits associated with those specially funded personnel
positions.

The Ordinance also provides for a Citizen Oversight Committee appointed by the City
Council of the City of Waterford to review the revenues generated and the expenditures of
the revenues.

The special tax, if approved, will be effective April 1, 2006 and shall continue through
March 31, 2026 unless extended by the voters of the City of Waterford.
