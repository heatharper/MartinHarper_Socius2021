ORDINANCE AUTHORIZING SPECIAL TAX
TO FUND EMERGENCY SERVICES
FOR SEVERELY PHYSICALLY DISABLED PERSONS

This special tax would fund the provision of emergency attendant care, transportation services and adaptive/assistive medical equipment repair, coordination with governmental agencies related to the provision of emergency services,
and incidental case management services, to severely physically disabled persons as defined therein. The tax would be imposed at the rate of $0,008 (8/10 of
10) per square foot of improvements, and would be adjusted annually for inflation. Passage of the tax requires a two-thirds vote.

Financial Implications: The Special Tax Rate of $0,008 (8/10 of 10) per
square foot of improvements would result in an annual cost of $15.20 for an
average 1,900 square foot home.

It is estimated that the tax will cost taxpayers no more than the following average amounts for the first full year.
