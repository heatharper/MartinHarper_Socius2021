MEASURE “N”

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY

This Ordinance would establish a utility user tax in the City of Upland. The utility
user tax would apply to a consumer’s use of electricity, natural gas, telephone and cable
and satellite television services in the City. The tax would be levied on the charges
made for the utility service that appear on the consumer’s utility bill. It would be paid by
the consumer, collected by the utility and transmitted by the utility to the City.

The Ordinance limits the amount of the tax to no more than 4.25% of the
consumer’s utility charges. The City Council would be authorized to reduce and adjust
the rate of the tax from time to time and make other changes to the ordinance, but the
City Council could not increase the rate above the 4.25% cap without voter approval.

Persons who are of specified low income, or the head of a household and are
both sixty-two (62) years old or older and a recipient of supplemental social security
benefits, are eligible for an exemption to the tax. Specified exemptions also apply to
governmental and non-profit organizations.

The utility user tax is a general tax, the revenues from which would be placed
into the City’s General Fund, and the City would be permitted to use the revenues for
any valid municipal purpose, such as police, fire and library services as well as
maintenance of streets and parks. As a consequence, this measure would take effect
only if approved by a majority of those voting on the measure at the November 7, 2000
General Election.
