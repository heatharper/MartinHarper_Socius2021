CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE P

The City Council of the City of Healdsburg has placed Measure P on the ballot for
the November 5,2002 election to ask voters to affirm the imposition of the City’s
existing general tax on the use of hotel accommodations in the City.

On April 19, 1965, pursuant to its authority under California Revenue and
Taxation Code sections 7280 et seq., the City Council adopted Ordinance No.
469, codified as Chapter 18, Article III of the Municipal Code, which provided for
the imposition and collection of a general excise tax on the privilege of using hotel
accommodations in the City (a "transient occupancy tax” or ‘TOT”) to be paid by
hotel users and collected by hotel operators.

The City Council subsequently adopted Ordinance No. 569 on September 17,
1973; Ordinance No. 598 on June 2,1975; Ordinance No. 737 on November 21,
1983; and Ordinance No. 885 on December 7,1992, all increasing the rate of the
TOT, which is currently ten percent (10%) of the room rate.

As a general tax, revenue from the TOT is not restricted to a specific use.

The effect of the approval of Proposition 218, a statewide initiative approved by
the voters in November 1996, which added Articles XIIIC and D to the California
Constitution, was to require cities that had previously adopted some kinds of
general taxes to submit those taxes to the cities’ voters to affirm their continued
imposition. On-going litigation over the scope of Proposition 218 and Proposition
62, however, continues to create uncertainty for many cities regarding which
general taxes instituted require voter approval.

The City Council placed Measure P before the voters to foreclose any future
challenges to the legitimacy of the TOT.

As required by state law, Resolution No. 86-2002 sets forth the type of tax,
amount of the tax, manner of collecting the tax, exemptions, refunds, use of the
proceeds and other related matters.

The continued collection of the tax would be affirmed only if Measure P is
approved by a majority of those voting on the issue.
