IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
MEASURE K



The San Juan Bautista City Council has placed Measure K on
the November 2, 2004 ballot asking voters to adopt an ordinance
that would allow the City to impose a general transaction and use
tax of .75% (three-quarters of one percent) of the retail sales price.
The proceeds of this tax would be used for general governmental
purposes as determined by the City Council.

Currently, retail sales in San Juan Bautista are taxed at the rate
of 7.25%. Of this tax, 6% goes to the State,1% goes to the City,
and .25% goes to the County. The 1% sales tax is deposited into
the City’s general fund where it is available to fund general
governmental service. 

A recent change in state law allows cities to impose a transaction
and use tax, which is a form of sales tax. Measure K, if passed by
voters, would adopt an ordinance that allows the City to impose a
special transaction and use tax at the rate of .75%.

A “yes” vote is a vote to adopt the ordinance allowing the City
to Impose a general transaction and use tax at the rate of .75%.
A “no” vote is a vote against adopting this ordinance. 

Measure K requires a “yes” vote of a majority of the voters to
pass.
