Impartial Analysis from Albany City Attorney
In 2000 Albany voters approved a tax for Advanced Life Support to provide funds for paramedic fire engines.
Measure G, if approved by 2/3 of the voters, would modify the manner by which the tax is calculated for commercial and industrial properties. Measure G proposes to calculate the assessment of these non-residential properties on the basis of size of the property. Currently, a commercial property, irrespective of size, pays an assessment equivalent to two residential units. An industrial property pays an assessment equivalent to four residential units. If Measure G is approved, every 1,200 square feet of commercial or industrial property will constitute an equivalent residential unit. Thus, commercial properties greater than 2,400 square feet and industrial properties greater than 4,800 square feet, will pay a larger assessment than before under the formula in this Measure. Commercial properties less than 2,400 square feet and industrial properties less than 4,800 square feet will pay less. The proposed calculation will result in larger revenues to the City from commercial and industrial properties. This formula is identical to the formula approved by the voters in 2002 for the assessment for the companion Advanced Life Support Transport component of the Emergency Medical Service program.
