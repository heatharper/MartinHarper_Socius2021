CITY ATTORNEYâ€™S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE D

This measure, if approved by two-thirds of the voters, would authorize a special tax to be used only
for park maintenance throughout the City of Antioch. 

Currently, neighborhood parks are maintained by landscaping assessment districts. In a recent mail-in
election, some neighborhoods approved continuation of assessments and some did not. Neighborhood
parks in areas which did not receive property owner approval are no longer being maintained by the
City.

This measure would allow a tax of $10.00 per month to be collected on each water bill. If the measure is approved, it would have the effect of disbanding the landscaping assessment districts, and instead, replacing the funding source for park maintenance with this special tax, which would be used to maintain parks throughout the community. The tax could be increased by the City Council not more than 2% per year, if needed for park maintenance. The City Council has announced its intent to provide a reduced tax rate or exemption for	eligible	senior	citizens	and	disabled	persons who	meet	the	present criteria for lower water rates. 

This has been an impartial analysis of the measure prepared by the City Attorney, pursuant to Elections
