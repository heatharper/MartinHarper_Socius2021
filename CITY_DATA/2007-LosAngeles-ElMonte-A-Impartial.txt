IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE A

Measure A, if approved, would reduce the current utility users tax rate for
telecommunications use from 7% to 6.5%. By way of example, the amendments
would reduce the tax that already applies to telecommunications devices such as
cell phones and land line telephones from 7% to 6.5%.

El Monte voters approved the City’s current utility users tax ordinance in 1991.
Measure A revises the 1991 utility users tax ordinance by restating portions to
establish modern definitions for the taxation of telecommunications services in
the City.

The proposed amendments to the City’s utility users tax relative to
telecommunications services include:

-	Reduction of the current utility users tax on telecommunications services by
0.5% (from 7% to 6.5%);

-	The preservation of existing utility user tax exemptions for seniors (62 years
of age or older) and the disabled;

-	Procedures for verifying that the telecommunications tax has been properly
collected and that all revenues have been properly expended;

-	A requirement that the existing federal law ban on the taxation of broadband
services trump any language which would otherwise permit such taxation
under the ordinance;

-	A modern definition of telecommunications services and ancillary services
that is technology-neutral and includes the use of internet protocol (VoIP)
and private networks for providing telecommunications services;

-	Administrative tools for addressing telecommunications taxation issues
including administrative rulings and sourcing, bundling and nexus guidelines;

-	Elimination of ambiguous language in the current ordinance that is the
subject of litigation in other cities.

Unlike other taxes voted on in recent City elections, the City’s utility users tax is
a general tax which means Measure A may be approved by simple majority vote.
All revenue generated by the tax goes into the City’s general fund to provide
government services, including, but not limited to: police, fire, public works,
parks and recreation and other essential government services. Currently, the
utility users tax on telecommunications services represents approximately $3.65
million or 7% of the City’s general fund revenues.

The impact of the tax rate reduction is expected to be revenue-neutral; that is to
say, the tax rate reduction coupled with the modernization of the ordinance
language should neither increase nor decrease the total amount taxes already
collected by the City for telecommunications,
