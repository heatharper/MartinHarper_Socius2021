CITY OF ALTURAS
CITY ATTORNEYâ€™S
IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE O

Measure O authorizes the City of Alturas to continue
the supplemental charge of $1.50 per meter on monthly
water rates to fund mosquito abatement in the City of
Alturas for a period from November 15, 2011, to June
30, 2016, unless further extended by a vote of the
electorate in the City of Alturas.

At an election held on April 9, 1980, a ballot measure
was passed by the electorate of the City of Alturas
that authorized the City to add a supplemental charge
of $0.50 (50 cents) to the minimum monthly water rate
per meter to fund a mosquito abatement program in the
City of Alturas. At a later date the 50 cents addition to
the minimum water rate and the mosquito abatement
program were both discontinued.

On March 9, 2004, the City of Alturas re-implemented
the 50 cents supplemental charge to the minimum
monthly water rate as authorized in 1980 and again
commenced a mosquito abatement program. At a
later date the City of Alturas Council determined that
the 50 cents supplemental charge authorized in 1980
was insufficient to cover the then current and projected
future costs of the mosquito abatement program.

At an election held on November 7, 2006, the electorate
of the City of Alturas approved an increase in the
supplemental charge of 50 cents per meter for the
mosquito abatement program to a supplemental charge
of $1.50 per meter to fund the mosquito abatement
program through November 15, 2011.

Passage of Measure O will authorize the continued
funding of the mosquito abatement program through
June 30, 2016, at the $1.50 rate per meter.
