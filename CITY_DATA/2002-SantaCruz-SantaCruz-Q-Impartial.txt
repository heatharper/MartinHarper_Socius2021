Impartial Analysis of by City Attorney

This ballot measure, if adopted by City voters, would amend the Santa Cruz Municipal Code by raising the transient occupancy tax rate from the current rate of 10 percent to 11 percent.  The transient occupancy tax is a tax paid by hotel and motel guests who spend fewer than 30 consecutive days in a hotel or motel in the City.  The tax is on the room rent paid.  For example, a hotel guest currently pays $10.00 tax per night on a $100.00 hotel room.  If the ballot measure is adopted, the hotel guest would pay $11.00 tax per night on a $100.00 hotel room.  The ballot measure would require the City to dedicate the tax revenue received by the City as a result of the tax rate increase to a special segregated “Conference and Visitors Promotion Fund” account.  All tax revenue deposited in the Conference and Visitors Promotion Fund account would be used exclusively for the promotion of tourism in the County of Santa Cruz.  In addition, the ballot measure would require the City to annually contract with the Santa Cruz County Conference and Visitors Council and the money deposited in the Conference and Visitors Promotion Fund would be disbursed periodically to the Santa Cruz County Conference and Visitors Council for its use in promoting tourism within the City and County.  The ballot measure would also require the Santa Cruz County Conference and Visitors Council, as a condition to receiving this funding from the City, to submit an annual accounting demonstrating that the funds provided by the City have been used for their intended purpose.   Currently 100% of transient occupancy tax revenues, computed at the rate of 10 percent, are dedicated to the City’s General Fund and General Capital Improvement Fund.  Because the proposed transient occupancy tax rate increase would be imposed for a specific purpose, the ballot measure proposes a special tax as defined by Article XIIIC of the California Constitution.  Accordingly, for the ballot measure to be adopted, it must receive a two-thirds “yes” vote.
