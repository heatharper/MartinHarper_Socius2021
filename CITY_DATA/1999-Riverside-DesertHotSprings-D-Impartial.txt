IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE “D”

By Resolution No. 1999-08 the City Council of the City of Desert Hot Springs (the “City”) submits for voter approval a measure approving an ordinance
repealing the existing 3% City utility users tax and replacing it with a new one-year 5% utility users tax (the “One-Year Utility Users Tax”). It is
estimated that, if the voters approve Measure “D,” up to $720,000 will be collected under the One-Year Utility Users Tax between the date of voter
approval (June 8,1999) and June 30,2000.

The City is experiencing a financial crisis, with a current-year budget deficit of over $1,000,000. The City now collects over $400,000 in annual
revenues from the existing 3% utility users tax, which expires on June 30,1999. If Measure “D” is not approved by a majority vote of the electors, the
budget deficit could grow to $1,400,000. Since state law requires the City to balance its budget, the City would have to consider very severe cutbacks
in City services, including police protection and fire protection, if Measure “D” is not approved by the voters.

The One-Year Utility Users Tax is a 5% tax on electricity, gas, water and sewer, telephone and cable television service charges. The tax will be
collected by the utility companies from each customer and then paid to the City. The One-Year Utility Users Tax expires on June 30,2000.

The One-Year Utility Users Tax is a general tax, and revenues collected under the One-Year Utility Users Tax may be used to pay for the cost of
general City operations, including police and fire protection.

Voting yes for Measure “D” means the voter approves the collection of the One-Year Utility Users Tax under the new utility users tax ordinance.

Voting no for Measure “D" means the voter does not want the One-Year Utility Users Tax enacted.
