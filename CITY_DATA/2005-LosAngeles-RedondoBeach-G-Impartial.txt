IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF PROPOSITION G

A BALLOT MEASURE TO INCREASE THE
TRANSIENT OCCUPANCY TAX

The City of Redondo Beach’s ordinance currently
authorizes the City to impose a transient occupancy tax
on hotel guests, which is collected and remitted to the
City by hotel operators, in the amount of ten percent
(10%) of the rent charged by the hotel operator to the
hotel guest.

Proposition G, if adopted, would amend the City’s
ordinance to authorize the City to increase the transient
occupancy tax to not more than twelve percent (12%) of
the rent charged by hotel operators to hotel guests.
