IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY TULARE CITY ATTORNEY

MEASURE C

The City of Tulare imposes a Utility User’s Tax on persons, including individuals
and businesses, who receive telephone, electricity, natural gas, water and/or
cable television utility services within the City limits. The applicable tax is 7% of
the user’s utility bill. This percentage will not change as a result of this
Measure.

However, the current maximum tax any one party can be required to pay on any
individual utility service in a given calendar year is $560.00. This maximum
amount was set more than 20 years ago and has not been increased since
then.

The Tulare City Council is seeking voter approval to increase this maximum
amount by $150.00 per year until it reaches the amount of $2,060 per year in
2012 and to allow the City Council to increase the maximum tax thereafter as it
deems appropriate and necessary.

This increase is expected to affect only a small percentage of the largest utility
users within the City and is intended by the City Council to have such larger
utility customers pay their “fair share” when compared to the Utility User’s Taxes
paid by other utility customers.
