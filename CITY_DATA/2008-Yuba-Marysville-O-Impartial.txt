IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS FROM CITY ATTORNEY
MEASURE O

Measure O, if adopted by a majority of the voters voting on the
measure, would enact an additional one half cent sales tax within
the City of Marysville. This means that the sales tax rate would increase
by one-half of one percent (0.5%). The sales tax is also referred to
as a “transactions and use tax." The current sales tax rate in the City
of Marysville is seven and one-quarter percent (7.25%). Accordingly,
if this ballot measure is approved, the Marysville sales tax rate would
increase to seven and three quarters percent (7.75%).

The proposed increased City of Marysville sales tax, like the current
sales tax, would be collected at the same time and in the same
manner as existing sales taxes.

All revenue generated from the proposed sales tax increase would
be deposited into the City's General Fund and, accordingly, all monies
collected pursuant to the sales tax increase would be used by the
City to pay for City operations and programs, such as police, fire,
building and general administration of the City. The City would not
be bound to use the tax monies for any special purpose or for any
particular projects, facilities, or programs. As such, this ballot measure
proposes a 'general tax,' rather than a ‘special tax’ and requires a
simple majority vote for adoption.
