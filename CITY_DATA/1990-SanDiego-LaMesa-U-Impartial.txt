CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS

In the City of La Mesa, a tax is charged for the privilege of occupying a hotel room for a period
of time no more than thirty consecutive days. The tax Is commonly referred to as a Transient
Occupancy Tax. At the present time, the tax is equivalent to eight percent (8%) of the rent
charged for the use of the hotel rooms. The purpose of this measure is to increase the tax to
ten percent (10%) of the rent charged. This tax applies only to “transient” occupancy of hotels
which means the tax is charged only when a person is occupying a hotel room for less than
thirty consecutive days. "Hotel" is defined as any structure, or any portion of any structure, which
is occupied or intended or designed for occupancy by transients for dwelling, lodging or sleeping
purposes and is held out as such to the public. “Hotel” does not mean any hospital, convalescent
home or sanitarium. The revenue received from this tax will be used for general governmental
purposes and State law requires majority voter approval to increase this tax for general
governmental purposes.

if this measure is defeated, the Transient Occupancy Tax will remain at eight percent (8%).
If approved by the majority of the persons voting on this measure, this increase in tax shall take
effect on January 1,1991.

A “yes” vote means you are in favor of the increase of the Transient Occupancy Tax to ten percent (10%); a “no” vote means you are opposed to such an increase.
