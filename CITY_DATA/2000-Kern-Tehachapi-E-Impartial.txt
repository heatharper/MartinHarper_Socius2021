IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY	
CITY OF TEHACHAPI MEASURE E	

The Transient Occupancy Tax is a charge on all guests at hotels, motels, and father lodging places which is added to and calculated from the charge for the room. This ballot measure will increase the charge from 8% of the room rate to 12%.	Tehachapi citizens do not pay the Transient Occupancy Tax (TOT); it is a bed tax collected from visitors using local Motels.  The TOT revenue will directly fund improvements toward further enhancements of the appearance and infrastructure of Tehachapi that will benefit everyone.

An increase in the Transient Occupancy Tax will provide additional income to the City of Tehachapi which will accrue to the benefit of the City residents. On the other hand, it likely will increase the price for rooms at hotels and motels within the City of Tehachapi.	Citizens living in the city receive additional economic benefits by having a portion of the TOT money spent for road maintenance projects and law enforcement personnel.  Since 1983 Tehachapi has collected 8%. Other cities similar in size such as Taft, Shatter and Delano have been collecting 10%. Increasing the TOT by 4% will place Tehachapi in balance within our geographical area by matching the City of Bakersfield which is also 12%.
