IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE J

In November, 2002, East Palo Alto voters approved a measure which
accomplished the following:

•	validated and allowed continued collection of the five percent (5%)
utility users tax until November 30, 2006; and

•	imposed said utility users tax on cellular telephones and similar
communications technology.

The utility users tax, which generates approximately $1.4 million per
year, goes into the City’s General Fund and is used for general government
purposes, including police and public safety, parks and recreation, street
improvements, youth and senior citizen services and the like. The tax is
collected on electricity, gas, telephone, cable, water services and mobile
communication technology such as cellular telephones.

This proposed measure, if approved by a simple majority of voters
voting on the measure, would remove the November 30, 2006 expiration of
the tax, in effect making it permanent.
