ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY

This initiative ordinance, if approved by the voters, will allow the City to impose a two
and one-half percent (2-1/2%) tax on utility use. The proceeds of the tax will be used to
defray the costs of providing City services and to supplement the City's general fund.

The tax will be imposed on telephone, cable television, electric and natural gas services.
The tax will be collected on the utility provider’s utility bills, and will be paid by the utility
user. The tax will be remitted to the utility company, which in turn will make periodic
disbursements to the City.

Senior citizens over 65 years of age and certain low income utility users are exempt from
payment of the tax. These users must file yearly exemption claims with the City

demonstrating the basis for exemption.

This initiative ordinance will become effective upon a "yes” vote of a majority of the
persons voting in this election.
