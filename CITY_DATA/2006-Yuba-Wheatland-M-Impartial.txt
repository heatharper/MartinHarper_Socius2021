IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY THE CITY ATTORNEY
MEASURE M

The Wheatland City Council proposes to adopt a transient occupancy
tax (sometimes also known as a motel tax). The City Council has
unanimously approved the tax measure, subject to approval by a
majority of the City voters.

The tax would be charged to guests of hotels, motels and similar
structures intended for occupancy by persons occupying a room for
less than 30 days, The tax would not be levied against City residents
or property owners (unless they stay in a hotel or motel in Wheatland).
Hotel or motel operators would be required to register with the City,
collect the tax from the guest, and remit the tax revenue to the City.
The ordinance sets forth procedures to enforce the levy and collection
of the tax.

The amount of the tax would be ten percent of the rent charged
by the hotel or motel operator. This is the same tax rate charged by
the County of Yuba, County of Sutter, City of Marysville, City of Yuba
City and City of Lincoln under their transient occupancy tax ordinances.
The tax revenue would be deposited in the City’s general fund to be
used for general City governmental purposes (for example, Police
Department, Fire Department, parks and recreation).

Currently, there are no hotels, motels or other structures in
Wheatland that would be subject to the tax. If the voters approve
the tax, it would apply to any hotel, motel or similar structure that
begins operating in the City.

Under state law, only the voters of the City may approve a new
City tax. Accordingly, the City Council is requesting the voters to
approve this tax.

A “Yes" vote on the measure would be a vote to approve the tax.

A “No” vote on the measure would be a vote against the tax.
