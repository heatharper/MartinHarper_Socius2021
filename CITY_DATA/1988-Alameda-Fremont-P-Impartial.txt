BACKGROUND

Section 53727 of the Government Code added by Initiative Measure approved November 4, 1986,
requires that all taxes imposed by local governments on or after August 1, 1985 shall be submitted to
the voters for approval prior to November 15, 1988. On August 27, 1985, the City Council of the City
of Fremont adopted Ordinance No. 1685 which amended Section 2-6302 of Article 3, Chapter 6, Title
II of the Fremont Municipal Code to provide for an increase in the Uniform Transient Occupancy Tax
rate from six and one-half percent (6.5%) to seven percent (7%). Therefore, if the City of Fremont is
to continue to impose the one-half percent (.5%) tax increase, it is necessary to obtain voter approval.
The tax is imposed on persons (transients) occupying hotels (and motels and other temporary lodgings)
for 30 days or less. The tax is added to the regular room charge and is collected by the operator of the
hotel and then paid over to the City.

PROPOSAL

This measure would authorize the City of Fremont to continue to impose the Uniform Transient
Occupancy Tax at its current rate of seven percent (7%).
