Impartial Analysis from City Attorney
In 1991, the City of Hercules adopted its first Utility Users Excise Tax. That tax has been continuously collected since its adoption.
This measure, if approved, will continue the Utility Users Tax for a period of 20 years at the same 6% rate that has been collected since 1991. It will remain applicable to telephone communication services, electricity usage, gas usage, water usage and video service usage, as defined. All taxes will be collected by the service providers and remitted to the City. The tax will automatically expire in 20 years, unless it is again extended by a vote of the citizens of Hercules.
If this measure passes, the 1991 ordinance will be replaced by the proposed ordinance with no effect on other City ordinances. If this measure fails, the City will experience a substantial decrease in general fund revenue and will be compelled to consider corresponding decreases in City services.
