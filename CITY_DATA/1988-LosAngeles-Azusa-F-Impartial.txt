Proposition F, if approved, would enact Ordinance No, 2377 which (1)
increases the admissions tax on swap meet vendors to Two Dollars and Fifty
Cents ($2.50), (2) establishes a Twenty Cent ($.20) tax on admissions to swap
meets, and (3) establishes a tax of ten percent (10%) of the admissions price
on admissions to certain events and paid parking.

Currently, Section 3.40.010 of the Azusa Municipal Code imposes an admissions tax of One Dollar ($1.00) upon each admission of a vendor at a swap
meet held or conducted within the City. Ordinance No. 2377, if enacted, would
increase the admissions tax of a vendor at a swap meet to Two Dollars and
Fifty Cents ($2.50) and would impose an admissions tax of Twenty Cents
($.20) on each paid admission to a swap meet.

Additionally, the ordinance would impose an admissions tax of ten percent
(10%) of the admissions price of any event for which a fee is charged for admission, including, but not limited to, participation activities, exhibition, fair,
meeting, performance, sports event, race, dance, demonstration or attraction.
The ordinance would also impose an admissions tax of ten percent (10%) of
the admissions price paid for the right or privilege of parking a motor vehicle
for which right or privilege a separate or additional admissions price is
imposed.

Currently, Section 3.40.030 exempts from the admissions tax bonafide
employees of management, municipal, law enforcement or fire officers on official business, members of the press in the performance of their duties and other
persons whose admission to the place is required for the performance of some
duty to or work for, the event or the facility. This ordinance would expand
the persons exempt from the admissions tax to include persons attending an
event or parking for an event of a bonafide religious organization and persons
attending motion picture performances.

The ordinance would also allow the City Council to amend the ordinance with-
out a vote of the people, but only to the extent necessary to implement the
procedures for collection of the tax, exempt certain events from the application
of the tax, adjust the rate of the tax but not to exceed the amount set forth
in the ordinance, and as permitted by Government Code Sections 53720, et
seq.
