PROPOSITION O


THE WAY IT IS NOW: The City imposes an Emergency Response
Fee on each telephone line. This fee is deposited in the 911
Emergency Response Fund and may only be used for costs to operate and improve the City's 911 system. In other cities, emergency
response fees have been legally challenged as taxes and not fees.

In addition, the City collects a utility users tax on charges for tele-
phone communication services (Telephone Users Tax). The
Telephone Users Tax does not apply to residential landline services. It also does not apply to certain other services.

THE PROPOSAL: Proposition O would replace the Emergency
Response Fee with a general tax (Access Line Tax) at the same
rates and with the same exemptions. Revenue from this tax would
go to the City's General Fund.

Proposition O would also revise the Telephone Users Tax to:

• Define "telephone communications services" to include cur-
rent and future technologies for telephone communications,
including voice over internet protocol (VOIP) services, and

• Give examples of the types of charges subject to this tax,
including charges for conference calls, voicemail, and call
waiting; activation, termination, and late payment fees; and
universal service charges.

Proposition O would continue the Telephone Users Tax exemption
for residential landline services. Certain other services would also
continue to be exempted.

Proposition O would also state that voters approve the City's past
collection of the Telephone Users Tax and the Emergency
Response Fee.

A “YES” VOTE MEANS: If you vote "yes," you want the City to
replace the Emergency Response Fee with the Access Line Tax at
the same rates and with the same exemptions, and to revise the
Telephone Users Tax.

A “NO” VOTE MEANS: If you vote “no,” you do not want the City
to make these changes.
