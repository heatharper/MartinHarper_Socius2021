CITY OF KING
IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY OF
INITIATIVE TO REPEAL UTILITY USERS' TAX ORDINANCE
MEASURE L

An initiative to repeal the City of King's two-percent (2%) utility
users' tax has been presented to the City of King and has
qualified for placement on the November 5, 2002 ballot for
consideration by the voters of the City of King. The initiative
would amend the King City Municipal Code by repealing the
utility users' tax, first adopted by the City of King in 1993, in its
entirety.

The present ordinance places a two percent (2%) tax oh
charges for the following utilities: telephone, electricity, gas
(delivered through mains or pipes), water and cable television.
The utility users' tax accounts annually for approximately
$200,000 of the City's General Fund revenue. General Fund
revenues are used to provide many general City services such
as police and fire protection, public works, recreation, and for
other municipal purposes.

If the initiative is approved by a majority of the voters voting on
the measure, the repeal of the utility users' tax will take effect on
January 1, 2003. Passage of this measure would remove
approximately $200,000 annually from the City of King's
General Fund revenues and mean the City would have
approximately $200,000 less in annual tax revenues available
for the payment of general governmental activities such as
police and fire protection, public works, and recreation, than it
would receive if the initiative were not approved. If the initiative
were not approved, the City would continue to receive tax
revenues at the same 2% tax rate currently in effect.
