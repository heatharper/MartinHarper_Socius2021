The Admissions Tax is a tax on the admission price to
a live sporting, athletic, theatrical or entertainment event
which occurs in the City of Inglewood. It is commonly
referred to as a “visitor oriented" tax since the burden of
the tax falls on the patron of the event, often a visitor to the
City, rather than on Inglewood residents or businesses.
The tax has been in effect since 1972 and has been
increased from time to time.

Prior to September 1996 the tax amounted to sixty
cents per admission. In September, the City Council
adopted an increase in the tax equivalent to 5% of the
admission price. The increase was not intended to go into
effect until July 1, 1997 and is expected to result in an
increase in revenues of $1,000,000 annually.

In November 1996 the voters of the State of California
amended the Constitution by adding Article XIIIC §2 (c),
which requires that any taxes increased between January
1,1995 and November 6,1996 be approved by a majority
of the voters before it can continue to be imposed. The
Admissions Tax increase adopted by the City Council in
September 1996 is therefore required to obtain voter
approval.

This measure seeks to obtain voter approval of the
increased Admissions Tax in order to comply with the new
provisions of the California Constitution.
