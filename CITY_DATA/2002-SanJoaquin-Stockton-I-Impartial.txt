IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE I
Prepared by City Attorney

The City Council of the City of Stockton has placed
Measure I on the March 5, 2002 ballot to ask voters to consider
amending the Municipal Code to decrease the existing utility user
tax in two phases and to provide energy tax rebates to some
businesses in the Enterprise and Mixed Use (MX) zones of the
City.

Currently the Stockton Municipal Code imposes an
eight (8%) percent tax on users of telecommunications,
electricity, gas, water, and video services provided in the City.
Measure I proposes amending Chapter 8, Part VI of the Municipal
Code to reduce the tax rate by one (1%) percent on July 1, 2002
and another one (1%) percent on July 1, 2003.

Measure I additionally proposes to amend Chapter 8,
Part IV of the Municipal Code to provide businesses in the
Enterprise and Mixed Use (MX) zones of the City with a rebate of
a percentage of the energy and/or gas user taxes paid by the
businesses. The percentage would vary depending on the
number of employees of the business. Businesses with more
employees would receive a larger subsidy.

The City estimates that the two-year reduction in the tax
rates, combined with the energy tax rebate, would result in a loss
of approximately $8 million dollars to the City’s General Fund,
which pays for police, fire, parks, libraries, and general City
services.

At the request of members of the public, the City
Council has asked the voters to consider Ordinance No. 012-01,
which would amend the Municipal Code as described above. A
copy of the Ordinance is available in the Stockton City Clerk’s
office located at 425 N. El Dorado Street, Stockton, California
95202.

The reductions of the utility user tax rate and the energy
tax rebates proposed in Ordinance No. 012-01 will not become
effective unless Measure I is approved by a majority of those
voting on the measure.
