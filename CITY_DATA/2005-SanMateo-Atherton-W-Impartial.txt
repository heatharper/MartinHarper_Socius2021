IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE W

INITIATIVE AUTHORIZES RENEWAL OF SPECIAL TAX
TO FINANCE MUNICIPAL SERVICES AND
CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS

This initiative Measure proposes to add a new ordinance to the
Ordinance Code of the Town of Atherton that would allow the City Council
to renew a Special Tax on Real Property to finance Municipal Services,
such as police protection, street repair and maintenance, drainage facility
repair and maintenance, and capital improvements where other sources of
revenue are not sufficient because of restraints imposed by Article XIIA of
the California Constitution also known as Proposition 13. The ordinance
would correspondingly increase the appropriations limit under Article
XIIIB of the California Constitution.

The City Council must conduct a duly noticed public hearing on the
proposed tax after adoption of the annual budget. The tax may not exceed
the total amount of expenditures necessary to provide adequate levels of
municipal services and capital improvements, as determined by the City
Council, after deducting the projected revenue to be gathered from sources
other than the Special Tax.

The tax on individual parcels may not, however, exceed in any year the
amounts set forth in Section 4 of the proposed ordinance.

The tax will be a lien on individual parcels and may be collected by the
Town or the County Tax Collector at the option of the City Council.

Any monies raised by this Special Tax may be used only for the
described municipal services and capital improvements. In accordance
with Article XIIIB of the California Constitution, all revenues received in a
fiscal year and the fiscal year following it in excess of the Townâ€™s
appropriations limits during that fiscal year and the fiscal year immediately
following it shall be returned by a revision of tax rates or fee schedules
within the next two subsequent fiscal years.

Authority to levy this tax will commence with the fiscal year 2005-
2006 and will expire with the fiscal tax year 2009-2010, and may only be
amended or repealed by a two-thirds vote of the people.
