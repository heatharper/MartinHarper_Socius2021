Proposition D, if approved, would enact Ordinance No. 2375 which would
increase the transient occupancy tax to ten percent (10%).

Section 3.32.030 of the Azusa Municipal Code currently imposes a transient
occupancy tax in the amount of seven and one-half percent (7 1/2%) of the
rent charged by the operator of a hotel or motel. Ordinance No. 2375, if
enacted, would amend this section and provide that the tax would be ten per-
cent (10%) of the rent charged by the operator.

The ordinance would also amend the definition of “Tax Administrator” from
City Clerk to Director of Finance.

The ordinance would also allow the City Council to amend it without a vote
of the people, but only to the extent necessary to implement the procedures
for collection of the tax and to the extent permitted pursuant to Government
Code Sections 53720, et seq.
