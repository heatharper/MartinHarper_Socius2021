ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY

This proposed ballot measure would re-enact Chapter 3.18 of the Municipal Code of the City
of Loma Linda and establish therein a 1.25% utility users’ special tax to fund increased law
enforcement services.

This ballot measure includes the following:

•	Amends Section 3.18.180 by substituting a new “sunset clause” automatically
terminating the utility users’ tax on June 30, 2000, unless the tax is extended by the
voters at the regularly scheduled City Council election held prior to June 30, 2000.

•	Adds Sections 3.18.190 and 3.18.190A which establish a 1.25% utility users’ special
tax for law enforcement salaries, equipment, and related expenses.

•	Adds Section 3.18.200 requiring that proceeds of the special tax be placed in a special
fund to be used only for the specified law enforcement purposes.

•	Adds Section 3.18.210 specifying that any special tax proceeds are to supplement the
existing 1996-97 budget expenditures for law enforcement services, and requiring that
said baseline budget be maintained from other funding.

•	Amends Sections 3.18.040, 3.18.050,3.18.060, 3.18.070, 3.18.090 and 3.18.100 to
reduce the tax rate on specified utilities from the prior 3% flat rate to a lesser rate
composed of the total of any special tax rates approved by the voters, including the
proposed 1.25% tax for law enforcement services.

The proposed measure includes a standard severability clause.
