CITY ATTORNEYâ€™S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS
LIBRARY PARCEL TAX MEASURE Q

Contra Costa County currently provides a base library service that allows the two Walnut
Creek branch libraries to be open 29 hours a week. City and private funds have in recent years
enabled the libraries to be open 35 hours a week. The hours the libraries are now open are not
consistent from day to day. A parcel tax is proposed by the Walnut Creek City Council to keep the
Walnut Creek libraries open a minimum of an additional 13 hours a week, for a total of 48 hours a
week. The parcel tax will also be used to replace worn and outdated books, materials, and
equipment and to maintain reading and educational programs and services for children, students,
adults and seniors. The tax rate will not exceed $22.00 a year on a single-family residential parcel.
The tax will be imposed on each single-family residential parcel and other equivalent units as
specified in Ordinance 1987, Attachment A. The tax must be approved by two-thirds of the voters.

The amount of the proposed parcel tax will be reduced or eliminated altogether in any year
when additional funds from other sources, such as matching funds from Contra Costa County,
additional state funds for library operations, or a county wide or state wide library tax, are available
to support basic services more than 60 hours a week.
