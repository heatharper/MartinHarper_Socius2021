IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE D

Measure D, the Pacifica Vital City Services Protection
Measure, is a one percent transactions (sales) and use tax
(TUT) to raise revenue for general City purposes, such as
police, fire, 9-1-1 emergency response, street and pothole
repair, and youth recreation programs; to improve traffic
flow and safety; and to protect local coastal areas and
beaches from polluted storm water runoff and trash. This
is a local tax to be placed in the City of Pacifica’s General
Fund and could not be taken away by the State of California
or the County of San Mateo.

State law allows cities to adopt TUT ordinances with voter
approval and to have them administered along with other
sales taxes. Measure D was placed on the ballot by the
Pacifica City Council to ask voters to approve an ordinance
enacting a one percent (1%) TUT to be administered by the
State Board of Equalization. The TUT would be a general
tax and its proceeds to the City would go into the City’s
General Fund and could be used for any legal City purpose.
It would expire in 2016.

Measure D includes accountability provisions requiring
the City Council to (i) have an independent third party
annually audit collection of the tax and the expenditure of
its proceeds, (ii) appoint a Citizen’s Oversight Committee
to review those expenditures and (iii) make the auditor’s
and Citizen’s Oversight Committee’s reports available to
the public.
