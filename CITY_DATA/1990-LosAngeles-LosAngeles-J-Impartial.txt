Special Tax for Police Communications 911 System Improvements
THE ISSUE:

Should the City be allowed to impose a special tax to repay up to $235
million in bonds to expand and improve the police radio dispatch and
communications/911 system?

THE SITUATION:

The City’s police radio dispatch and communications system is outdated. During busy times, there are delays to citizen requests for
emergency services. The dispatch system is unable to meet the growing demand for emergency services. The system has no back-up
facility.

THE PROPOSAL:

This measure would allow the City to impose a special tax to pay for
up to $235 million in bonds to expand and improve the City's Police
communication systems. These bonds would be used to:

—	replace and expand the Police Department’s radio system,
which includes 911 calls

—	move the current dispatch center to a new facility

—	build a new back-up dispatch center

—	increase the number of 911 telephone operators, police dispatchers, and police radio channels.

This special tax will be imposed on residential, business and commercial property within the City. The amount of tax for each parcel of
property would be based primarily on the size of the buildings and
improvements on the property.

The average, annual tax is estimated to be about 97$ for each 100
square feet of improvement. The owner of a 1500 square foot home
would pay about $14.00 each year over the 20 year life of the tax.

This measure will become law only if two-thirds of the voters
approve it.
