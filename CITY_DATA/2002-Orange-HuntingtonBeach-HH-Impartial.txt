IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
MEASURE HH
ANALYSIS

This measure, if approved by the voters, would have the effect of requiring
an electric power plant to pay the same utility tax as do residents and
businesses of the City of Huntington Beach.

This measure, if approved by the voters, would operate in the following two
respects:

1.	It would amend Huntington Beach Municipal Code Section 3.36.010, by
deleting the definition of “electrical corporation” from the list of definitions
contained in subsection (g) of Section 3.36.010.

2.	It would amend Huntington Beach Municipal Code Section 3.36.080, by
deleting subsection (b), renumbering subsection (c) to subsection (b),
and renumbering subsection (d) to subsection (c).

The most important change would be the deletion of subsection (b) from
Section 3.36.080. Subsection (b) of Section 3.36.080, as it presently exists,
excludes, from the utility tax, “charges made for gas to be used in the
generation of electrical energy by an electrical corporation.”

CONCLUSION

This measure, if approved by the voters, would change existing law by
deleting the exclusion presently enjoyed by an electric power plant from
paying the same utility tax as do residents and businesses of the City of
Huntington Beach.
