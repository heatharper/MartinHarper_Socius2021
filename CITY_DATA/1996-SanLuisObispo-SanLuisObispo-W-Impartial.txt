CITY CHARTER PROPOSITION
MEASURE W

Existing Charter Section 709 requires the City Council to adopt a
Personnel Policy by ordinance. At the same time, ongoing changes
to federal and state law with respect to personnel matters, and employee negotiations, require frequent amendment to the Cityâ€™s personnel policy. The requirement that such changes be done only by
ordinance adds an unnecessary procedural burden and expense.

This Charter amendment would enable the City Council to adopt a
personnel policy by ordinance or resolution at its discretion, or as
otherwise required by law.
