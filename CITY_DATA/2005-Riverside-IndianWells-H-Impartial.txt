IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE “H”

In 2000, the voters of the City of Indian Wells (“City”) approved an admission tax in the maximum amount of five percent (5%) of the charge for
admission to specified events. Proposed Measure “H" would increase
the maximum allowable admission tax from the current five percent (5%)
to ten percent (10%). The admission tax would remain five percent (5%)
for calendar year 2006. The City Council would be authorized to either
decrease or increase the admission tax for any calendar year, provided
that the tax may not exceed ten percent (10%).

The admission tax is paid by any person who pays an admission charge
to attend any entertainment, amusement or recreational activity in the
City. Typical events subject to the admission tax include sporting
contests, athletic events, exhibitions, concerts, lectures, theatrical and
musical performances, fairs, and festivals if an admission is charged.
Events held by non-profit organizations are exempt. Thus, the tax does
not apply to events held by a nonprofit country club, social club or tennis
club. Nor does it apply to events held by schools or governmental
entities. The tax is not applied to complimentary tickets or event
sponsors.

The revenues received from the tax can be used for any municipal purpose. The measure will take effect only if it is approved by a majority
of the Indian Wells electors voting on the measure.
