Impartial Analysis from Albany City Attorney
The Albany City Council has placed this parcel tax measure on the ballot at the request of the Albany Library Board. Alameda County provides library services for Albany. The library is located in the Community Center building.
 In 1994 Albany voters approved the Library Services Act of 1994, which instituted a library parcel tax to add 21.5 hours of service to the County's base schedule of 15.5 hours. The existing parcel tax is currently $57.34 for a single family residence. This measure, if approved, would provide supplemental funding to enable the Albany Library to restore staff hours that have been cut this past year and would allow the library to open on Sunday for four hours. Funds would also be used to purchase materials, maintain existing service levels, and to establish a reserve fund.
 A single family home and condominium would be taxed at $24.00 per parcel. Multiple unit residential parcels would be taxed at $18.00 per unit. Every 5,000 square foot of commercial or industrial property would be taxed as an ERU, at $24.00. Vacant land would be taxed at 1/2 the developed rate.
 This measure includes exemptions for low-income homeowners and renters. The tax each year can be adjusted by the U.S. Department of Labor Employment Cost Index (ECI), with a maximum adjustment of 5% annually.
