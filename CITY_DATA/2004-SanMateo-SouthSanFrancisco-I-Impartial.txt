IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE I

Transient occupancy tax is a tax that is imposed on the privilege of
using overnight lodging facilities, such as hotels, motels and “bed and
breakfast” businesses, and is frequently referred to as a “hotel tax”. The
current transient occupancy tax rate in South San Francisco is eight percent
(8%) of the room rental rate. If approved by two-thirds of the voters at this
election, Measure I would authorize a one percent supplemental special tax
to the transient occupancy tax. The result would be a transient occupancy
tax rate of nine percent (9%).

The additional tax revenues received if this measure is approved may
only be used to fund public safety, park, library and recreation services.
The supplemental tax proposed in Measure I is special tax and therefore
requires that two-thirds of the voters approve Measure I for the special tax
to be adopted.

The existing transient occupancy tax, adopted in August 1966, was last
increased in 1978 to the current rate of eight percent (8%). In addition, the
voters of South San Francisco have previously approved a special tax of
$2.50 per room night to fund the acquisition, renovation, maintenance and
operation of the South San Francisco Conference Center. Measure I will
not modify the existing eight percent transient occupancy tax and the
existing special tax to benefit the Conference Center. The current transient
occupancy tax of eight percent and the current special tax of $2.50 per
room night will remain in effect regardless of whether Measure I is
approved or not approved by the voters in this election.
