Impartial Analysis from Berkeleyâ€™s City Attorney
Currently, the City's existing utility users tax raises $13,900,000 for general governmental purposes such as police, fire, health and human services, recreation, and city administrative services, through a 7.5% tax on gas, electric, telephone, and video service bills. This amendment would increase that tax rate temporarily, beginning 2005 through 2008, to make up for existing and projected decreases in other sources of revenue. The increase in the tax would expire December 31, 2008, after which the tax would revert to the current rate of 7.5%. However, the Council could repeal the tax increase at any time. This measure would also authorize the expenditure of the additional tax proceeds resulting from the rate increase through calendar year 2008; and ratify various technical changes to the utility users taxes (Berkeley Municipal Code Chapter 7.70) that have been adopted by the City Council.
Financial Implications
The proposed tax increase would increase the annual cost for a Berkeley resident with combined utility (gas, electricity, cable, telephone and cell phone) bills currently totaling $300 per month (or $3,600 annually) from $270per year to $324 per year.
