IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE “F"

By Resolution No, 2000-05 the City Council of the City of Desert Hot
Springs (the “City”) submits for voter approval a measure approving an
ordinance enacting a utility users tax imposing a tax of 5% on amounts
paid by users for utility services and having an expiration date of June 30,
2005 (the “Five-Year Utility Users Tax”). 

The City has been experiencing a financial crisis for the prior four
fiscal years and continues to be undergoing a financial crisis, with an
expected general fund balance cumulative deficit of over $2,200,000 for
fiscal year 2000-2001. In June, 1999, the People of the City of Desert Hot
Springs enacted a 5% utility users tax having an expiration date of June
30, 2000 (the “1999 Utility Users Tax"), the City expects to collect
approximately $720,000 under the 1999 Utility Users Tax, if the 1999
Utility Users Tax expires on June 30,2000, without being replaced by the
Five-Year Utility Users Tax, the City would lose general fund revenues in
fiscal year 2000-2001, and in each fiscal year thereafter, in the approximate amount of $720,000, Even if the Five-Year Utility Users Tax is
approved, an estimated reduction of $700,000 in City services and costs
will be necessary unless the parcel tax being submitted for voter
approval concurrently with the Five-Year Utility Users Tax is also
approved.

The Five-Year Utility Users Tax is a 5% tax on electricity, gas, water
and sewer, telephone and cable television service charges. The tax will
be collected by the utility companies from each customer and then paid
to the City. The Five-Year Utility Users Tax expires on June 30,2005.

The Five-Year Utility Users Tax is a general tax, and revenues
collected under the Five-Year Utility Users Tax may he used to pay for
the cost of general City operations and/or to reduce certain indebtedness
of the City,

Voting yes for Measure F means the voter approves the collection of

the Five-Year Utility Users Tax under the new utility users tax ordinance.
Voting no for Measure F means the voter does not want the Five-Year
Utility Users Tax enacted.
