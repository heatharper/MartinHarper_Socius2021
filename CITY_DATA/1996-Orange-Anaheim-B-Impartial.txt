IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
MEASURE B
CITY OF ANAHEIM

Transient occupancy taxes are taxes collected by the City of Anaheim from persons who occupy hotel and motel rooms in the City of Anaheim.
These taxes are not imposed upon property owners or residents of Anaheim.

Transient occupancy taxes are not pledged or legally committed to any particular purpose or enterprise. These taxes are deposited in the City’s
general fund and are used for a variety of general governmental services, programs and capital improvements.

For example, Anaheim presently uses these revenues to fund police and fire services, as well as the convention center and libraries, and pay
for repair of local streets and roads.

if Proposition 218 is approved by the electorate at the statewide election on November 5,1996, it will require that any local tax imposed, extended
or increased by a local agency after January 1, 1995, be approved by the voters of that local agency or be reduced to the level that existed prior
to January 1, 1995.

The City’s transient occupancy tax upon guests renting hotel and motel rooms in Anaheim was increased by 2% as of July 1, 1995.

If approved by the voters of Anaheim, this measure will allow the City to continue to collect this 2% increase in the transient occupancy tax from
hotel and mote! guests. If not approved by the voters, the City will be allowed to collect transient occupancy taxes at a rate not greater than existed
prior to January 1,1995.

This measure requires a majority vote of those voting on the measure for approval.
