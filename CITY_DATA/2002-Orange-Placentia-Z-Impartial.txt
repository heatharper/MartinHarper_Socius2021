IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
MEASURE Z

The City currently charges a. utility user tax of 3.5% on the amount utility
customers within the City pay for water, telephone, electricity, gas, and
cable television services. That tax is collected by each utility as part of the
regular utility bill. The rate of the tax has periodically been adjusted over the
years in response to general fund and budget considerations from the
1970s and as recently as 1985, the utility user tax rate was 5%. The 
revenue the City receives from the utility user tax is deposited in the Cityâ€™s
General Fund, which pays for general City services and ongoing operations,
including police services, parks, recreational programs, senior citizen
programs, maintenance of City property and other municipal services.

Measure Z would increase the utility user tax rate from the current 3.5% to
the previously established 5%. It is estimated the increase would raise
approximately $850,000 in revenue which would be used to fund general
City services and ongoing operations, including police services, parks, 
recreational programs, senior citizens programs, maintenance of City
property and other municipal services.
