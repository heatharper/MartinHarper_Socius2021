Impartial Analysis from County Counsel

Measure P proposes to raise revenue to be used for police services by authorizing a five year parcel tax on all taxable property within the City.
If approved, Measure P would assess a flat rate parcel tax on all taxable properties within the City. The tax shall not exceed sixty-four dollars ($64) per year per single family residential unit. The tax formula establishes an Equivalent Residential Unit (ERU) for properties based on land use. All parcels will be taxed at a rate not to exceed sixty-four dollars ($64) multiplied by the ERU. (See Table in Voter Pamphlet for ERU formula.) The parcel tax will be collected annually, commencing on July 1, 2007, and will automatically terminate five years thereafter.
The proceeds from the Measure will be deposited into a special account separate from the City's General Fund and will be spent solely for police services. A Citizens' Oversight Committee will be responsible for reviewing the expenditures of funds collected from the parcel tax, determining whether the funds were spent in furtherance of police services, and issuing a written public report on their findings annually.
The City Council adopted a resolution on July 10, 2006, calling this election and submitting this Measure to a vote of the electors of the City. Two-thirds of those voting on the Measure must approve the Measure for it to pass. A "Yes" vote on Measure P is a vote to authorize the City to assess the parcel tax for police services. A "No" vote on Measure P is a vote against authorizing the parcel tax for police services.
