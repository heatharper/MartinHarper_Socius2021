IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
CITY OF CALIFORNIA CITY
SPECIAL TAX MEASURE G

If two-thirds of those voting approve, Measure G will authorize the City of
California City to levy a yearly special tax in the amount of $53.00 per parcel
or lot. The tax could be levied for four fiscal years starting July 1,1991. The
proceeds of the tax will be deposited in a special fund and expended only for
municipal purposes. These purposes include the replacement of the annual
assessment levied by the California City Community Services District, the
replacement of taxes for interest and redemption of certain bonds, and the
replacement of water and sewer standby charges once levied by the City.
Approval of this special tax will also constitute approval of an increase in the
appropriations limit for the City by an amount equal to the special tax.
