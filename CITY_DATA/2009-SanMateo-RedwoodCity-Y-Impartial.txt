Impartial Analysis of Measure Y

The City’s business license tax ordinance was enacted in 1990, and the
existing tax rates have not been increased since 1994. The tax is not
regulatory. It currently generates approximately $1.3 million annually for
the City’s General Fund. The tax is only imposed upon business owners
conducting business within the City, including residential and commercial
leasing.

The proposed amendments to the business license tax would raise the tax
by approximately 16% for three consecutive fiscal years beginning July 1,
2010. For each year thereafter, commencing on July 1, 2013, the business
license tax would be adjusted for inflation.

This tax would eventually result in approximately $650,000 of additional
annual revenue which would be placed in the City’s General Fund. In
accordance with the California Constitution, voters must approve such a
General Tax by majority vote.

The proposed amendments to the business license tax ordinance include
the following:

Sections 32.156 and 32.157 would be added to increase the
business license tax by 16.67% on July 1, 2010, July 1, 2011, and
July 1, 2012; and

Section 32.158 would be added to increase the maximum annual
tax by 16.67% on July 1, 2010, July 1, 2011, and July 1, 2012;
and

Section 32.159 would be added to increase the business license
tax and maximum annual tax based upon the annual change in the
Consumer Price Index beginning on July 1, 2013.
