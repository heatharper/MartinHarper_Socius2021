CITY ATTORNEYâ€™S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS

The City of Del Mar is currently authorized by state law to share with the County of San Diego the
proceeds of a documentary transfer tax on the value of certain real property exchanges. A majority
vote of approval for this proposition would 1) amend the City's Charter to permit the direct
imposition of such a tax by the City of Del Mar, as part of its municipal affairs, and 2) permit the
imposition of the tax in an amount not to exceed $6 per $1,000 of property value.
