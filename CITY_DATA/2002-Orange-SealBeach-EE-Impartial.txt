CITY ATTORNEY'S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS
OF MEASURE EE

Ballot Measure EE proposes a 3% increase to the City’s Transient Occupancy Tax. Persons who stay in hotels in the
City, not the owner or operator of the hotel, pay Transient Occupancy Tax.

The City last adjusted the rate of the Transient Occupancy Tax fifteen years ago, increasing the amount of the tax from
7% to 9%.

If a majority of voters vote in favor of this Measure, City Code Section 22-25 would be amended to increase the
Transient Occupancy Tax rate by 3% to 12% of the rental rate charged by the hotel operator. Additionally, the City
Council could adjust the tax to any rate less than or equal to 12%, and could otherwise amend the City’s Transient
Occupancy Tax Ordinance, without further voter approval.

This measure, if adopted, would not allow the City to increase the rate of the Transient Occupancy Tax in excess of
12% without additional voter approval.

A “yes” vote on Measure EE enacts an ordinance increasing the City’s existing 9% Transient Occupancy Tax by 3%.
A “no” vote keeps the Transient Occupancy Tax at its current fate of 9%.
