MEASURE J

CITY OF HUNTINGTON BEACH

Advisory Measure:

This measure asks:

ADVISORY VOTE ONLY: "Should the City of Huntington Beach construct: a sports field on an undeveloped portion of Huntington
Central Park; athletic field lighting at high schools; a public gymnasium at Murdy Community Center; and fund youth sports field
grants by establishing a ten year citywide assessment district for
total of $11.5 million at a maximum annual cost of:

$24 per single family residence;

$10 per multi-family unit; and

$5 per business and mobile home unit?"

- Effect of the measure on the existing law:

As a matter of law, this measure would have no effect on existing
law because it is an "advisory vote only."

Operation of the measure:

The measure would operate as an "advisory vote only” and thus
would not operate to actually approve or disapprove the construction of the improvements reflected therein. The measure is intended to provide information to the City Council on whether the
Huntington Beach voters are, or are not, in favor of such construction and financing proposals.

The City Council would not be bound by this "advisory vote only.”
If the City Council wishes to proceed with the construction of the
sports field at Huntington Central Park and the public gymnasium
at Murdy Community Center, there would still need to be a new
affirmative vote of at least a majority of the electors voting on a
proposition to build on or in such parks, in addition to the affirmative
vote of at least four (4) members of the City Council to authorize
actual construction. The assessment district would likewise require the affirmative vote of at least four City Council members for
approval.
