IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY TOWN ATTORNEY MEASURE B


Measure B enacts by ordinance a Special Municipal Services Tax to be levied on all improved real properly within the boundaries of the Town of San Anselmo. The tax is proposed at the rate of $250 per year per residential living unit and per 1,500 square feet of structure of nonresidential use, effective July 1, 2006. This measure requires a two- thirds majority to pass and terminates 4 years from its effective date.


Under the ordinance, all proceeds from the taxes imposed are to be paid into a “Special Municipal Services Tax Account” to be used exclusively to restore and maintain Police, Parks and Library staffing and services and to maintain minimum staffing at the San Anselmo Fire Stations.  


The Town’s Finance and Administrative Services Director is to report annually to the Town Council on the amount of funds collected and expended and the status of any project to be funded by the special tax.


A Citizen’s Oversight Committee is to be established to monitor the annual expenditures from the special tax and to ensure they are made in accordance with the requirements of the ordinance.

Persons of low-income may apply for a full or partial rebate of the tax payment, to be decided by the San Anselmo Tax Equity Board. Properly used exclusively for educational, charitable or religious purposes is granted an exemption to the tax.


The State places limits on the amount of revenue that can be collected by cities and towns based on a calculation known as the appropriations limit. Therefore, voters are asked to approve an increase in the appropriations limit to authorize the additional revenue.
