IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
CITY OF MARINA
MEASURE D

City of Marina Ballot Measure D presents to the electors the question of whether the City’s five percent (5%) Utility User’s Tax shall
be extended for a period of two (2) years.

The City Council previously adopted Chapter 3.14 of the Municipal
Code which imposes a five percent (5%) tax on the use of utilities
and cable television within the City effective August 1, 1993. Section
3.14.170 states that the tax shall automatically terminate one year
after its imposition and that it was the intent of the Council at the
time of adopting the chapter that any extension would be done only
with an election of the citizens approving the extension. Although the
Council is not required by state law to submit the extension of this
tax to the voters, the Council unanimously voted to do so.

A ‘Yes' vote on this ballot measure is a vote in favor of extending
the existing Utility User’s Tax for a period of two (2) years.

A 'No' vote is a vote against the extension of the Utility User’s Tax.

If the measure passes the City Council would then formally consider
an ordinance extending the tax for two (2) years. The tax will only
be extended if it is approved by the City Council.
