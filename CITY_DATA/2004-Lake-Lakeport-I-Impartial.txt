CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS
OF CITY MEASURE I

Ballot Measure “I” proposes to raise revenue for general purposes for City of Lakeport by authorizing a one half cent sales tax within the City of Lakeport, The tax would be paid in addition to current sales taxes and would be collected at the same time in the same manner as existing sales taxes.

California Revenue and Taxation Code Section 7286.75
authorizes the City Council to levy a transactions and
use tax (a sales tax) at 0.5 (1/2 cent) rate, provided the
tax is approved by a majority of the voters voting in an
election on that issue. If approved, the Measure “I”
sales tax would become effective April 1,2005.

Measure “I” states that the 1/2 cent sales tax is to be
used “for community facilities and programs.” Because
this sales tax would be a “general tax,” the tax would go
into the City’s general fund and could be used for any
legal governmental purpose. The City would not be
legally bound in any way to use the tax monies for any
special purpose or for any particular facilities or programs.
