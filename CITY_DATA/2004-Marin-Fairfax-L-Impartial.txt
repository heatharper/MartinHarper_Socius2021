IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY THE TOWN ATTORNEY MEASURE L  


This measure, if passed by two-thirds (2/3) of the voters, would add Sections 3.20.080 and 3.20.090 to the Fairfax Town Code, imposing a special tax at a maximum rate of one hundred twenty-five dollars ($125.00) on each improved residential and business parcel within the boundaries of the town of Fairfax for a period of five (5) years. The measure requires that the revenue from the tax be used exclusively for the specific purposes of public safety, including police, fire, emergency medical and public works which includes hazard/safety improvements to public streets and sidewalks.  The remaining sections of Chapter 3.20 of the Fairfax Town Code shall remain unchanged.  A “YES” vote would be a vote to impose the tax, subject to the conditions and restrictions stated above.  A “NO" vote would be a vote to not impose the tax.
