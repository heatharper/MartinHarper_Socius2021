IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE “U”

This initiative Municipal Code amendment, if passed, would prohibit
the City from imposing the five percent (5%) utility users tax imposed on
telephone, electricity and gas services. Your “yes" vote means that the
five percent (5%) utility users tax would be repealed. Your “no” vote
means there would be no change to the current law, which allows the
City to impose a utility users tax.

Specifically, this measure would eliminate the five percent (5%)
utility tax on charges for consumption of: (i) intrastate telephone
services, (ii) electrical energy services, (iii) gas services, and (iv)
co-generated electrical energy services, ail of which are currently in effect
for business and residential customers within the City.

This measure would also require a majority vote of the people to
impose in the future any taxes, fees, monetary assessments for
consumption or use of any utility service within the City, including
electricity, co-generated electricity, gas, telecommunications, water,
television, refuse collection or sewer seance.

According to the City’s Finance Department, the average household
in Palm Springs pays less than $12 per month in utility users tax. If
passed, the City Is anticipated to lose approximately $5,8 million, or
13.6% of the general fund budget of $42 million. Utility users tax revenue
is unrestricted, and can be used for any general fund purpose. Approximately 49% of the City’s general fund budget is spent on public safety
services (police, fire). City officials forecast that a reduction of 13.8% in
the general fund budget will have to be accomplished by eliminating
some positions and cutting some City services, but no specific plan, of
reductions has been established at this time. This measure requires
approval from a majority of voters voting at an election to take effect.
