IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE BB

LEGAL

A “yes" vote on Measure "BB" is a vote to continue the existing
Business License Tax. Because state law does not provide for
elections on existing taxes, "BB" is a new ordinance that would repeal
and replace the existing Tax. It is essentially identical to the existing
ordinance. It fixes the tax rates at the existing levels. Any increase
in tax rates would require approval by the voters.

A “no" vote is a vote against continuing the Business License tax.
Under City Council resolutions, the Business License Tax will end
December 31,1996, unless "BB" passes or the tax is ruled legal.

Measure “BB” requires a simple majority vote to pass.

FISCAL

If Measure “BB" passes, there will be no impact on the city budget
or on taxpayers.

If the Business License Tax ends, the City’s General Fund would lose

approximately $400,000 in annual revenue. Under state law, the
City may not use cuts outside of the General Fund to offset the lost
Business License Tax.

Eliminating the Tax could cause some cuts in City services to the
public. The City Council has adopted a Plan to account for the
losses of the Utility ($7.1 Million) and Business License ($400,000)
taxes and for the pre-existing deficit ($1 Million). Information on
the Plan is outlined In the Impartial Analysis for Measure “AA".
