On March 10. 1976 the City of Newark adopted the last major revisions of its Business Tax Resolution.
This Resolution imposes a tax on the privilege of conducting business in the city.

The proposed measure will revise a number of business license tax rates. The business classifications
experiencing the greatest impact are as follows:

•	Section 2 - Those businesses with gross receipts over $1,600,000 will be paying an additional
amount gradually increasing from 7 cents effective in 1991 to 15 cents effective in 1996 per $1,000
for amounts in excess of $1.6 million.

•	Section 3 - Residential and non-residential property rental classification will pay based on gross
receipts similar to retail businesses in Section 2, instead of paying a fee of $47 for the first five and
five dollars for each additional dwelling unit.

•	Section 4 - The classification of manufacturers will pay at the rate of 10 cents per $1,000 instead
of paying based on Section 2 gross receipts.

•	Section 5 - The classification of professions will pay $1.30 per $1,000 of gross receipts instead of
43 cents per $100 of gross receipts.

•	Section 6 - The category of contractors will pay $96 for the first $100,000 plus 80 cents per $1,000
of gross receipts in excess of $100.000 instead of $93 for the first $100,000 plus $6 for each $5,000
in excess of $100,000.

•	Section 7 - The category of administrative offices will pay 20 cents per $1,000 of gross payroll
instead of paying according to Section 2 gross receipts.

•	Section 8 - The classification of warehousing will pay based on 20 cents per $1,000 instead of
paying according to the gross receipts under Section 2.

•	Section 10 - Isolated transactions or temporary vendors classification will pay $100 for a period up
to 90 days instead of paying $34 per day.

Other businesses may experience minor rate changes due to the simplification or the rounding of the
tax rates.
