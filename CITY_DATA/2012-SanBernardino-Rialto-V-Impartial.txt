
MEASURE V
CITY OF RIALTO

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE V

This Impartial Analysis for Measure V has been prepared by the City
Attorney pursuant to Section 9280 of the Elections Code of the State of
California.

Measure V will increase the business license tax on those businesses that use the City
of Rialto as a base to produce and deliver petroleum products throughout California. The
affected businesses are few that include British Petroleum, Chevron USA, Conoco
Phillips, Kinder Morgan, SFPP and Tosco. Each of these businesses will be required to
pay a license tax in the sum of $1,500 for each increment of $250,000 in gross receipts.

In addition, CalNev, a petroleum piping business, will be required to pay a business
license tax for the first time ever by repealing Section 5.04.070 that exempts CalNev
from paying the business license tax.

The business license tax will not be increased for any other business including gasoline
stations.

The People of the City of Rialto have the exclusive authority to impose or increase taxes
under Proposition 218 adopted as a state ballot measure in 1996. Since then, the Rialto
City Council has not had the authority to impose or increase taxes.

Measure V is on the ballot because the City of Rialto has identified a new source of
revenue to replace revenue lost due to the economic downturn, elimination of the
redevelopment tax increment and the state taking of other city revenue.

Measure V gives the People of the City of Rialto the opportunity to increase the business
license tax on a few businesses so that existing service levels can be maintained. The
effects on Rialto’s business license tax ordinances are as follows:

•	Section 5.04.020 defines the petroleum businesses that will pay the increased
business license tax.

•	Section 5.04.060 lists the business license tax rate for all businesses in
Appendix A of Chapter 5.04 and allows the City Council to reduce the tax rates
in Appendix A but return them in the future.

•	Section 5.04.062 increases the business license tax rate on businesses based
in Rialto that produce and deliver petroleum products throughout California.

•	Section 5.04.070 that exempts petroleum pipeline businesses from paying the
business license tax is repealed - thereby requiring them to pay the business
license tax.

•	Section 5.14.010 prevents petroleum businesses from avoiding payment of the
increased business license tax by being classified as other existing businesses.

•	Sections 5.14.020, 5.14.030 and 5.14.040 require businesses defined in
Chapter 5.14 to pay the business license tax and administrative fee at the rates
in Appendix A.

•	Section 5.56.040 requires businesses defined in Chapter 5.56 to pay the
business license tax and administrative fee at the rates in Appendix A.

•	Section 5.68.035 requires the businesses defined in Chapter 5.68 to pay the
business license tax and administrative fee at the rates in Appendix A.
