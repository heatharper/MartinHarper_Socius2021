THE WAY IT IS NOW: The City currently imposes a 25 percent tax
on the cost of parking in most paid parking spaces located in San
Francisco.

This parking tax does not apply to fees for valet parking services
when the valet parking company does not pay for the use of the
property where it parks the cars.

THE PROPOSAL: Proposition E is an ordinance that would
increase from 25 percent to 35 percent the total tax paid for most
paid parking spaces located in San Francisco. This additional revenue would be deposited in the City's General Fund.

A “YES” VOTE MEANS: If you vote “yes,” you want to increase
the parking tax from 25 percent to 35 percent and you want the 35
percent parking tax to apply to valet parking services even if the
valet company did not pay for use of the property where it parked
the cars.

A “NO” VOTE MEANS: If you vote “no,” you do not want to make
these changes.

Proposition E would also apply this 35 percent parking tax to fees
for valet parking services even if the valet company did not pay for
use of the property where it parked the cars.
