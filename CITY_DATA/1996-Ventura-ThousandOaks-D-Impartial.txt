CITY ATTORNEYâ€™S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS 

BALLOT MEASURE "D"

Under Proposition 13 and state law, any new special tax to be enacted by
a city, or any increase in an existing city tax, must first be approved by the
voters in a city election. Measure D would increase the existing
Thousand Oaks city tax on new residential construction. That tax is
levied on the developer of new mobile home spaces, or the developer of
new dwelling units (houses, condominiums or apartments) to be
constructed within the city. The amount of the tax on a new mobile home
space is a fixed sum for each new space created. The amount of the tax
for each new dwelling unit is based on the number of bedrooms to be
contained in each new dwelling unit.

This measure would increase the tax from the present $100 per new mobile
home space to $400 per space, from $100 to $400 for each new one
bedroom dwelling unit, from $150 to $600 for each new two bedroom
dwelling unit, and from $200 to $800 for each new three or more bedroom
dwelling unit. The tax revenues generated from this tax are dedicated to,
and can only be used for, the acquisition of or improvement to public open
space or parks. Thus, this measure imposes a special tax requiring a 2/3rds
voter approval of those voting on the measure.

The tax authorized under this measure would not apply to any existing
residential dwelling unit or the remodeling of an existing home.
