MEASURE F


All businesses in the City are required to pay an annual business
license tax to the City for the right to do business in the City. This tax is
set by City ordinance. The existing provisions, adopted by the voters in
1988, provide for an automatic five percent (5%) increase every year
irrespective of inflation or cost of living variations. Measure P would
replace the existing automatic five percent (5%) increase with an
automatic annual increase equal to the percentage increase in the
Consumer Price index (CPI) for all Urban Wage Earners. Each December the City would determine the status of the CPI as calculated for the
Los Angeles-Anaheim-Riverside Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical
Area and would then apply that factor to the previous year's tax and
adjust for the coming year accordingly.

Measure P contains a maximum or cap of five percent (5%) per year
even if the CPI is higher. The Base Year for the CPI calculation would
be December, 1998, and the tax amount to which the increase would
be applied is the tax imposed in each July thereafter.
