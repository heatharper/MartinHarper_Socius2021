MEASURE G

This ballot measure if adopted by a majority of city voters, would increase the tax
charged for the privilege of occupying a hotel room in the City of Riverbank from four percent
(4%) to nine percent (9%). The transient occupancy tax is a tax paid by hotel and motel guests
in the City. The tax is on the room rent paid. For example, a hotel guest would currently pay
$4.00 tax per night on a $100.00 hotel room. The revenue received by the City from this tax
would be placed in the general fund.
