CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS

In 1981, the newly incorporated City of Poway adopted the County of San Diego Transient
Occupancy Tax (“TOT"). The TOT is charged to persons who rent hotel and motel rooms in the
City. Generally, it is paid by visitors, not by City residents. It is collected by the innkeeper and sent
directly to the City. In 1981, the TOT rate was six percent (6%) of the room rate paid by the visitor.
The current City rate is six percent (6%).

The TOT is a general tax. Its proceeds are deposited into the City's General Fund and used to pay
a variety of City expenses. On July 9,2002, the City Council approved an increase in the tax to ten
percent (10%). By the terms of Proposition 218, adopted by California voters in 1996, the increase
can only take effect if a majority of the voters voting in a general election approve the increase.

TOT rates in the county vary between 6% and 10.5%. Fourteen of the eighteen cities have TOT
rates of 10% or more. Some examples of the TOT currently payable elsewhere in San Diego
County are as follows:

City of San Diego	10.5	%
City of Escondido	10	%
City of Del Mar	10	%*
City of Carlsbad	10	%
City of Coronado	8	%
City of Santee	6	%

With the construction of a new hotel in the Poway Business Park, the 4% increase in the TOT would
yield an estimated additional $300,000 annually in City revenue.

If this measure is approved, the taxes of City residents will not increase. City residents will only pay
the tax if they rent a hotel or motel room in the City.

This proposition requires approval of a majority of those voting.

A "yes” vote is a vote to increase the TOT paid by visitors to ten percent (10%) of the room rate. A
“no" vote is a vote to leave the TOT at six percent (6%) of the room rate.

"Increase to 10.5% by voter approval on November ballot.
