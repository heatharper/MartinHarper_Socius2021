IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE Z
Prepared by City Attorney

TO REDUCE THE CITY OF STOCKTONâ€™S UTILITY
USER TAX FROM EIGHT PERCENT (8%)

TO TWO PERCENT (2%)

The City of Stockton received a certified initiative petition
circulated by proponents Ralph Lee White and Diane
Probasco to place Measure Z on the November 5, 2002,
ballot. The voters are asked to consider amending Chapter 8,
Part VI of the Stockton Municipal Code to decrease the
existing Utility User Tax from its current rate of eight percent
(8%) to a rate of two percent (2%), commencing July 1,2003.

This petition to decrease the tax rate was circulated
pursuant to article XIIIC, section 8, subdivision (b), of the
State Constitution, the State Elections Code, and the Charter
of the City of Stockton. The petition, as circulated, had a
commencement date of July 1, 2002. On August 14, 2002,
the Superior Court of San Joaquin County ruled that the
Measure, as drafted, was unlawful as a retroactive tax
reduction and the court ordered the Measure reformed to
have a prospective commencement date of July 1,2003.

The court further directed the City Council to place the
Measure on the November 5, 2002, ballot.

On March 26, 2002, the Stockton City Council adopted
Ordinance 015-02 C.S. amending chapter 8, part VI of the
Stockton Municipal Code to provide for an eight percent (8%)
tax on user of telecommunications, electricity, gas, water, and
video services provided in the City, through June 30, 2004.
Commencing July 1, 2004, this tax rate will be reduced one-
quarter percent (1/4%) annually through June 30, 2011.
Beginning July 1, 2011, and thereafter, the tax rate will be six
percent (6%).

Measure Z would amend Chapter 8, Part VI of the
Stockton Municipal Code to reduce the current eight percent
(8%) tax rate to two percent (2%), effective July 1, 2003.

The City estimates that Measure Z, if adopted, would
result in an annual reduction in general fund revenue of
approximately $25 million. The general fund pays for City
services such as police, fire, parks, libraries, public works
maintenance and improvements, and general City services.
