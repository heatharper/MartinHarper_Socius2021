

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE O

This ballot proposition extends for four years the existing City of San Marino
Public Safety Tax for paramedic, police and fire protection services. The Public
Safety Tax is a tax on each parcel of real property in the City and is authorized
under the authority of Section 4 of Article  of the California Constitution.
As a special tax, the proceeds can only be used for paramedic, police and fire
protection services. The City may not use the funds for any other purpose.

Approval of the measure will extend the Public Safety Tax for a period of four
years. The tax would expire at that time unless again approved by the voters.

The base and maximum rates in the measure were not increased above those
included in the measure approved by the voters four years ago. The measure
contains credits for parcels owned by senior citizens whose income does not
exceed certain levels and, due to Proposition 13, for parcels purchased
subsequent to March 1,1975.

As a special tax, the measure requires a two-thirds vote of the persons casting
ballots at the election. A “YES” vote on Measure O extends the existing Public
Safety Special Tax and assessment amounts for four years. A “NO” vote would
eliminate the Public Safety Special Tax at the end of the current fiscal year.
