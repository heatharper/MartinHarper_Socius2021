In 1994 the voters of California adopted Article, section 26 of the California
Constitution, which prohibits local governments from taxing nonprofit organizations based on their gross receipts. Prior to this date, the City’s business license
tax ordinance had imposed a gross receipts tax on nonprofit organizations, which
raised approximately $250,000 per year. Article, section 26 does not prohibit local agencies from taxing nonprofit organizations on bases other than gross
receipts. This measure would amend the City’s business license tax ordinance to
impose a charge of $0.51 (51 cents) on the square footage of business improvements
over the first 120,000 square feet, and would be indexed for inflation.


Financial Implications: This charge, which would be indexed for inflation, is
expected to raise approximately $250,000 in FY 1998 1999, and greater
amounts thereafter.
