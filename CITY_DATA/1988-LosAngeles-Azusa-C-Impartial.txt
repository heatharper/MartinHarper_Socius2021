CITY ATTORNEYâ€™S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF PROPOSITION C	

Proposition C, if approved, would enact Ordinance No. 2374 which would (1)
increase the tax on sanitary landfills ten percent (10%), and (2) increase die
minimum tax to $100,000.00 per year.

Section 5.12.120 of the Azusa Municipal Code imposes upon all sanitary landfill and disposal facilities and sites a quarterly business license tax in an amount
equal to two percent (2%) of gross receipts received from disposal of waste matter on the site, provided that the total amount of the tax shall not be less than
Thirty-Five Thousand Dollars ($35,000.00) per calendar year.

Ordinance No. 2374, if enacted, would amend Section 5.12.120 and increase
the tax to ten percent (10%) of gross receipts and increase the minimum tax
to One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000.00) per calendar year.

The ordinance would also allow the City Council to amend it without a vote
of the people but only to the extent necessary to implement the procedures
for the collection of the tax and to the extent permitted by Government Code
Section 53720, et seq.
