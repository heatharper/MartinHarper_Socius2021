Impartial Analysis from City Attorney

If adopted, this Measure would increase the sales tax in Watsonville by 1/4%. The sales tax is sometimes referred to as "transaction and use" tax. The present sales tax rate in Watsonville is 8%. This measure would therefore increase the rate to 8 1/4% (8.25%). The proposed increase would be imposed just like the present tax; upon the sale of tangible personal property sold at retail within the City limits and upon the storage, use, or other consumption of tangible personal property purchased from any retailer in the City limits. All revenue from the proposed tax would go into the City's General Fund and would be used by the City to pay for general City operations and services. This ballot measure is therefore a "general purpose tax" rather than a "special purpose tax" and requires a single majority vote.
