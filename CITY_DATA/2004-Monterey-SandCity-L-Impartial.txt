IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
MEASURE L	

State law authorizes Sand City to levy a transaction and use tax, in addition to the sales and use tax levied in the City under present law. A majority vote in favor of this proposition, together with approval by 2/3 of the members of the Sand City Council, would levy a transaction and use tax in Sand City at the rate of .05%.  


The transactions and use tax would be levied on the same activities now taxed under the sales and use tax law. The combined total of these taxes in Sand City would be 7.75%.  


Unlike revenues from the sales and use tax which are shared with other governmental agencies, the City of Sand City would receive all of the revenue from the new transaction and use tax levied in Sand City.
