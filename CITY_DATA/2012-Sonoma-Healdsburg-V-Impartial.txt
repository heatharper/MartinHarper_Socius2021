CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE V

The City Council of the City of Healdsburg (“City Council") has established
November 6,2012 as the date for an election on a proposed ballot measure to enact a one-half of one percent (0,50%) transactions (sales) and use tax. The current
sales tax rate is 8.00%. Ail proceeds from the sales tax will be collected by the
State Board of Equalization and remitted to the City for any legitimate governmental purpose. It is, therefore, a “general tax" requiring approval of a majority of the
voters.

The tax would be imposed on retail sales in substantially the same manner as the
existing sales tax, with retailers collecting it and remitting the funds to the State
Board of Equalization, which administers the tax in accordance with the California
Revenue and Taxation Code and distributes the funds to the City. If the ballot measure is approved by the voters, the tax will become operative on April 1,2013 and
automatically terminate ten years after it becomes operative unless extended by
the voters.

Approval of the ballot measure would adopt an Ordinance imposing the sales and
use tax and certain other administrative provisions and information relating to imposition of the tax, exemptions and exclusions (in accordance with state Saw). The
Ordinance requires the City to complete an annual report reviewing the collection
and expenditure of revenue from the tax, The annual report will be a matter of public
record. A copy of the Ordinance is printed in its entirety with the election materials.

A “Yes” vote is a vote to approve the Vz cent tax. A “No” vote is a vote not to approve
the tax. This measure will be approved if it receives a simple majority of “Yes”
votes.
