IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE D

This proposed initiative measure, if adopted by voters, would impose a
parcel tax for a term of 10 years for the limited purpose of enhancing police
services and programs to prevent violence and crime in East Palo Alto. As
a parcel tax, it is a special tax under California law, requiring approval by
two-thirds (2/3) of the voters voting on the measure.

Tax funds would be restricted to the following types of activities:

•	Community and neighborhood policing;

•	Violence prevention among youth and children;

•	Evaluation of programs by independent police experts;

•	Annual audits of expenditures;

•	Creation of a three-person oversight committee to make
recommendations to the City Council

The tax could not be collected in any year in which the actual
expenditure for police services drops below $8.6 million, as adjusted for
inflation. Conversely, the parcel tax could be increased annually to adjust
for inflation.

Owners of property would be responsible for paying the following tax:

•	$75 for each single-family residential parcel;

•	$40 for each occupied unit in a multi-family residential building
or a reduced rate if the unit is vacant for six months or more;

•	a single-family residential ‘equivalent’ rate for non-residential
parcels (i.e., commercial, industrial, public utility) based on the
frontage and square footage of the parcel, but would be
approximately for times (4x) the $75 single-family residential
rate.

Hotels would likely pay the ‘equivalent’ commercial rate. Vacant
parcels would be exempt if vacant for six months or more.

This proposed measure sets forth administrative details for
implementing the measure, including exemptions for qualified senior
citizens or disabled persons.
