CITY ATTORNEYâ€™S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE K

This measure if adopted by the voters would impose a parcel tax on all
improved Nevada City properties which may only be used for capital
acquisition and personnel costs for the fire department. The City has
the discretion as to how much of the tax is used for personnel versus
capital.

The annual fee would be as follows:

A)	$24 for each single family home and $16 for each apartment or
mobile home.

B)	$100 - $500 for commercial properties depending on the square
footage of the improvements on the parcel.

This parcel tax will be in addition to the tax approved for fire purposes
by the voters on November 4, 1986.
