CITY OF PLYMOUTH
CITY ATTORNEY IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS
MEASURE R

The City of Plymouth currently taxes the privilege of occupying a room
in a hotel or a similar place of lodging within the City. A hotel guest
pays the tax, and the hotel operator collects the tax and forwards it
to the City. The tax is called a “transient occupancy tax” (“TOT”) and
is frequently referred to as a “hotel tax.” The City of Plymouth’s current
TOT rate is six percent (6%) of the amount that the hotel operators
charges for the privilege of occupancy. The tax rate of six percent
(6%) has remained unchanged since the City first adopted the TOT
in 1980. Measure R, if approved by the voters, would increase the
TOT from six percent (6%) to ten percent (10%) of the amount charged
by hotel operators for occupancy.

The additional tax revenue generated by the increase in the TOT rate
would be deposited in the City’s general fund and may be used to
fund general public services. As such, the TOT increase is considered
a “general tax,” which must be approved by a majority of the electorate
in order to become effective.

A “yes” vote is a vote to approve the increasing the hotel tax to
ten percent (10%).

A “no” vote is a vote against approving increasing the hotel tax

to ten percent (10%).
