IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
MEASURE L

Prepared by Wheatland City Attorney

This measure would authorize the Wheatland City Council to levy
a City utility users tax. The tax would be levied upon every person
in the City using water and sewer services. The tax rate would be
35% of the water and sewer service charges, and the tax would
be levied against and collected from the utility service user. The
tax would be collected at the same time as, and along with, the
regular City utility service billing. The tax would be deposited in
the City general fund to be used for general governmental purposes. If approved by the voters, the tax would not be increased
nor extended to utilities other than City water and sewer without
subsequent voter approval.

“When the City adopted the utility users tax in 1994 without voter
approval, the City relied upon California court of appeal decisions
that held that the voter approval requirement of Proposition 62
(Government Code section 53720-53730) were unconstitutional.”
The California Supreme Court recently overruled those decisions,
and concluded that Proposition 62 is constitutional. The City Council therefore decided to submit this measure to the voters to decide
whether or not to readopt the tax pursuant to Proposition 62. Approval of the tax requires a majority vote of the City voters voting
on the issue.
