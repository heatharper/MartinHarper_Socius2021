ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY

This ballot measure arises from action taken by the Montclair City Council and submits to
the voters the question of whether the City’s utility users tax should be repealed effective
December 31, 1998.

The passage of this Measure would affect existing law by repealing, effective December 31,
1998, Montclair Ordinance No. 91-702, as amended. Ordinance No. 91-702, as amended,
currently provides for a utility users tax of 4.74% on specified utilities, with an exemption for
low-income residential users. In 1995, the original rate of 5% was reduced to 4.74% as a
result of the City Council’s adoption of an adjustment formula for decreasing the utility users
tax as sales tax revenues increase. The defeat of this Measure would have no effect on
existing law and would leave Ordinance No. 91 -702, as amended, in full force and effect. The
passage of this Measure would repeal Ordinance No. 91-702, as amended, in its entirety.
