IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY, CITY OF SEASIDE ORDINANCE 911 PROPOSED BY THE SEASIDE CITY COUNCIL ENTITLED, "AN ORDINANCE AMENDING THE SEASIDE MUNICIPAL CODE, SETTING THE UTILITY USERS TAX RATE AT SIX PERCENT (6%), AND DESIGNATING THE UTILITY USERS TAX AS A SPECIAL TAX DEDICATED SOLELY TO POLICE AND RRE PROTECTION SERVICES" MEASURE T  



The City of Seaside's measure proposes to amend the City of Seaside s Municipal Code Chapter 3.30 entitled "Utility Tax Law of the City' so that it will limit the tax rate imposed under Chapter 3.30 to an amount not to exceed 6% and to designate the utility user tax as a special tax that can only be used for police and fire protection services. The proposed Ordinance 911 also provides that the City Council may reduce the tax rate at any time by a resolution of the City Council.  Chapter 3.30 currently places a utility user tax on persons who receive and pay for electricity, gas. telephone, water and cable television service within the City. The tax is a percentage of the charges for these utilities and is currently assessed at the rate of 6%. Revenue from the tax is currently used for the general governmental purposes of the City of Seaside.  If this measure is approved by voters, the tax will be changed from a general tax now used for general governmental purposes to a special tax to be used only for police and fire protection services at a rate not to exceed 6%, unless and until another action is approved by the voters. Adoption of this Ordinance Amendment also retains the current utility tax user exemptions as set forth in Seaside Municipal Code Section 3.30.210 which apply to exemptions for persons sixty-five years of age or older or persons with a qualified disability.
