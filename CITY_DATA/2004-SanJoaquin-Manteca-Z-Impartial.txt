IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE Z

Prepared by City Attorney

City of Manteca’s Proposed .25%
Transaction and Use Tax on Retail Sales

This Ordinance, if passed by a majority of voters voting at the
general election, would impose a .25% Transaction and Use
Tax on retail sales to be administrated by the State Board of
Equalization. This tax, which is commonly referred to as a
Sales Tax, would apply in the same manner as the State
Sales Tax. The provisions of the Revenue and Taxation
Code which deal with the State Sales Tax are made
specifically applicable to this tax. The tax, being a general
tax, may be used for any governmental purpose.

This Ordinance will expire by its own terms on June 30, 2010.

The City of Manteca’s finance department estimates this tax
will generate a maximum amount of approximately
$1,500,000.00 annually.
