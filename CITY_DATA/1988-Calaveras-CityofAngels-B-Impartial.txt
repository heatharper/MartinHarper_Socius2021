IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
CITY OF ANGELS TRANSIENT OCCUPANCY TAX INCREASE
MEASURE B

At the present time, the City of Angels levies a 4% transient occupancy tax.
The City of Angels proposes to increase this transient occupancy tax from 4%
to 6%. This tax is also called the hotel/motel tax and is levied upon the bills of
persons who stay at hotels, motels, bed and breakfast businesses and similar
type businesses. The funds from this tax are paid directly to the City of
Angels and are deposited in the General Fund.

A “Yes" vote on this measure would increase the transient occupancy tax
from 4% to 6%. A "No” vote on this measure would leave the transient

occupancy tax at 4%. A simple majority of the vote cast is necessary to
increase the transient occupancy tax from 4% to 6%.
