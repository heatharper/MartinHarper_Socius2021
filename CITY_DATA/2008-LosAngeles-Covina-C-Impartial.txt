Measure C, if approved by a majority vote, would authorize an amendment to
Section 3.14.260 of the City’s Utility Users Tax Ordinance (Covina Municipal
Code, Chapter 3.14), extending the life of the City’s Utility Users Tax by an
additional ten (10) years (Tax would expire on March 16, 2019). All other terms
of the existing Utility Users Tax Ordinance would remain unchanged.

The Tax would be computed on the basis of monthly usage and certain service
charges, and would be collected by the service provider. Measure C would not
increase the current percentage rate of the Tax, but would maintain the rate at
six percent (6%).

The Utility Users Tax is a general tax. All revenue generated by the Tax would
go to the City’s General Fund to provide essential government services including,
but not limited to: police, fire and paramedic, street maintenance, services for
senior citizens, library, and parks and recreation.

This measure must be approved by a majority of the voters.
