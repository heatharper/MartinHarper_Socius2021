Impartial Analysis from County Counsel/City Attorney
This measure would authorize the levy of a special parcel tax to provide additional funds for the maintenance and operation of the Richmond Public Library. All funds obtained from this tax would be placed in a Library special Tax Fund, and the funds would be used exclusively for the maintenance and operation of the library.
The special parcel tax would be levied for only eight consecutive fiscal years, and would be allocated annually on the following classifications of property within the City of Richmond: (1) $19.80 on each single-family residential dwelling unit or residential unit in a residential condominium project, (2) $19.80 on the first residential unit of a multiple-family dwelling unit and $14.85 for each residential unit of the multi-family dwelling unit thereafter (excluding a condominium project), and (3) $39.60 for each non-residential parcel (including commercial, industrial and institutional) which does not currently qualify for an exemption from ad valorem taxation under California law.
The following properties would be exempt from the proposed special tax: (1) any property owned by any federal, state or local governmental agency; (2) any property owned by a house of worship or charitable or community service organization which qualifies for an exemption from ad valorem taxation under California law; and (3) any vacant property.
This special parcel tax would only be levied if approved by not less than two-thirds of the votes cast by voters voting on the special tax proposal.
