IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY	


If this measure is adopted by a majority of the voters, the City will be able to levy a fiscal option sales tax on retail sales within the City of Ridgecrest commencing January 1, 2005. The maximum amount of this tax is the rate of 3/4 of 1 % (0.75%) of the gross receipts from the sales of all sales. (For property purchased outside of the City but used in the City, an identical use tax will be assessed in lieu of the sales tax.)  

The City will use the proceeds of these taxes to pay for general government services such as police protection, fire protection, recreational services, and the repair of streets and roads.
