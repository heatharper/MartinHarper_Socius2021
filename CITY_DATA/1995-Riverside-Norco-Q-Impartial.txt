IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE Q

If approved by 2/3rds of the qualified electors of the City, this
ballot measure will add Chapter 3.50 to the City of Norco Municipal
Code, imposing a Police and Fire Protection Special Tax. The
proceeds of the Special Tax may only be used for the purpose of
providing fire suppression and police protection equipment or
apparatus and/or for paying salaries and benefits to firefighting and
police protection personnel.

The specific amount of Special Tax imposed depends upon the
number of equivalent dwelling units per parcel of property, based
upon a formula set forth in the Ordinance. A single family residence
is designated as one equivalent dwelling unit. The maximum Special
Tax for one equivalent dwelling unit may not exceed $96 per year.
The imposition of the Special Tax is conditioned upon the continued
allocation of funds to police and fire services of that amount actually
expended during the 1996-1997 fiscal year for the services, excluding any amounts derived from the Special Tax. The Special Tax will
not be imposed on low income or low and moderate income, senior
citizens or disabled persons.
