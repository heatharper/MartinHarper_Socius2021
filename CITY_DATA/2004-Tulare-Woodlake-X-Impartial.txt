IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY THE CITY ATTORNEY

MEASURE X

The City of Woodlake proposes Measure X to raise revenue by authorizing a one half cent sales tax increase within the City of Woodlake. The tax would be paid in addition to the existing state and local sales tax and would be collected in the same manner and at the same time as the existing tax.

California Government Code section 53723 and California
Constitution Article XIIIC 2(b) allows for the imposition of a sales tax if
approved by a majority of the voters within the City of Woodlake. If
approved by the voters, the sales tax would become effective no
sooner than January 1, 2005.

The revenue raised from the sales tax will be used to provide for
general government services.
