IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY

The Transient Room Tax Ordinance of the City of Fresno was adopted in 1964. Under this Ordinance,
persons staying in hotels for 30 consecutive calendar days or less, are required to pay a transient room
tax. The transient room tax, also known as the hotel room tax, are collected by the operators of the
hotels and deposited into the City's General Fund.

The current hotel room tax rate is 12% of the rent charged for a hotel room. On June 27,2000, the City
Council adopted a 1% increase in the hotel room tax in Resolution No. 2000-201. Under Proposition
218 (Article XIIIC, Section 2 of the California Constitution), any increase in the general tax must be
submitted for voter approval. Voters must approve the 1% increase in the hotel room tax for it to
become effective. For this reason, the City Council placed this Measure on the ballot.

The Measure requires a simple majority vote to pass. If the Measure passes, the hotel room tax will be
increased to 13%. If the Measure fails, the hotel room tax will remain at 12%. The City Controller
advises that the 1% increase to the hotel room tax will generate approximately $500,000 annually to the
City’s General Fund. A “yes” vote is a vote approving the 1% increase in the hotel room tax. A “no” vote
is a vote against the 1% rate increase in the hotel room tax.
