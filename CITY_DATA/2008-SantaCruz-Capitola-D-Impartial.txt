Impartial Analysis from City Attorney

In November 2004 Capitola voters voted to enact a temporary five-year one-quarter of one percent (1?4%) increase to the sales tax rate in the City of Capitola. The sales tax is also referred to as a "transactions and use tax." The previous sales tax rate in the City of Capitola was eight percent (8%). Accordingly, the 2004 ballot measure increased the Capitola sales tax rate to eight-and-one-quarter (81?4%) percent for the five-year period ending on March 10, 2010, increasing the cost of retail sales subject to the tax by 25 cents for every $100 of eligible sales consummated. This ballot measure, if adopted by the voters, would extend the current 2010 "sunset" date through the 2017 calendar year, meaning that the current eight-and-one-quarter (81?4%) percent sales tax rate would remain in effect through December 31, 2017. The extended Capitola sales tax, like the current Capitola sales tax, would be imposed upon the sale of all tangible personal property sold at retail within the jurisdictional limits of Capitola as well as upon the storage, use or other consumption of tangible personal property purchased from any retailer in the jurisdictional limits of Capitola.
All revenue generated from the proposed sales tax extension would be deposited into the City's General Fund and, accordingly, all monies collected pursuant to the sales tax extension would be used by the City to pay for general City operations and programs including public safety and street improvements. As such, this ballot measure proposes a "general purpose tax," rather than a "special purpose tax," and requires a simple majority vote for adoption.
