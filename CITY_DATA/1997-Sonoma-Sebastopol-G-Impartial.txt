CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE G

Cities and counties may tax persons who stay 30 days or less in motels,
hotels, or similar lodgings. Such taxes are called “Transient Occupancy Taxes”
(‘TOT”). The City of Sebastopol has had a TOT for many years (Ordinance No.
480). The amount of that tax is currently set at 6%; the proceeds of the tax going to
the General Fund, and may be used for any purpose.

This measure would increase the TOT from 6% to 10%. if passed, the
increased portion only, that is, the additional 4%, would be placed in special
accounts, and could be used only for the specified purposes set forth in the
measure, which are as follows:

-	one-half of the increase is for the marketing of Sebastopol as a
tourist destination; and,

-	one-half is for the installation and maintenance of Sebastopol’s
public facilities. 

The specified purposes for the tax increase cannot be changed without a
further vote of the people, but the City Council will have some discretion as to the
actual allocation of the increased taxes collected, within the basic categories set
forth above.

Since the tax increase is to be used for specified purposes it is a “special tax”
under Proposition 218, and must be approved by a 2/3 vote. If so approved, it will
become a valid and binding ordinance of the City, and will be considered as adopted
upon the date that the vote is declared by the City Council.

Whether passed or not, this measure will have no effect on the existing
TOT; the 6% tax will remain in effect regardless, and may continue to be used for
any purpose.
