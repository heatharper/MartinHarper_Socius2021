
CITY ATTORNEY'S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE H

Measure;

Shall Ordinance No. 736, an ordinance amending Rocklin Municipal
Code Section 5.24.030A to increase the Transient Occupancy Tax from
8% to 10%, be approved?

Analysis;

The City of Rocklin currently levies an 8% Transient Occupancy Tax
(TOT), often called the hotel/motel tax. This is a general fund tax
imposed upon the occupant of a hotel, motel or bed & breakfast
accommodation. The tax is remitted quarterly to the City of Rocklin by
the owner/proprietor of the lodging establishment. The City Council has
voted unanimously to increase the tax to 10% if the voting electorate
agrees.

State law (Proposition 62) requires that ail local general fund tax
increases be first approved by the majority of the voters in that city before
those increases can be enacted. Unlike a special tax where the revenues generated can only be used for a specified purpose, the revenues
from this tax will be placed in the City's general fund and be available
for any public purpose deemed appropriate by the City Council.

The ordinance specifically provides that, should the City Council so
elect, the City Council may repeal the 2% increase voted on herein, may
repeal the tax entirely, or may amend/delete all existing portions of the
current Transient Occupancy Tax Ordinance (Rocklin Municipal Code
Section 5.24  excluding tax rate increases, without going to the
voters for further approvals.

If the majority of voting electors vote “yes", Rocklin City Council Ordinance No. 736 will take effect to increase the Transient Occupancy Tax
from 8% to’ 10% of the hotel/motel/B&B room charge.

A majority "no” vote by the voting electors will indicate a lack of public
support for the Transient Occupancy Tax rate increase, and the tax will
remain at its current rate of 8%.
