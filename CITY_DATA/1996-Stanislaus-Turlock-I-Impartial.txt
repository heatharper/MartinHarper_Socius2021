CITY OF TURLOCK BUSINESS LICENSE ORDINANCE
MEASURE I

A yes vote on Measure I will impose a revised semi-annual tax on
all businesses. The rate of tax will be fifty cents (500) per $1,000
of gross receipts. There will be a minimum tax of $60 per year and
a maximum tax of $10,000 per year for large retail businesses, $2,000
per year for industrial businesses and $3,000 per year for high-value
retail equipment businesses.

Under the current law, last amended in 1968, the majority of the
businesses subject to a flat tax are currently paying $40 annually. Some
flat tax businesses pay up to $200 annually. Currently retail businesses
pay a semi-annual tax ranging from sixteen cents (160) to over one
dollar ($1) per one thousand dollars ($1,000) of gross receipts based
on a monthly average formula. Under the proposed new ordinance, many
small businesses, will have a reduced license tax.

It is estimated that this ordinance will generate additional revenue
of $135,000 per year which will be placed in the City's general fund
which supports police, fire and other general City services.
