CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE S

The City Council of the City of Santa Fe Springs placed Measure S, which
proposes a utility users’ tax, on the November 2, 2010, election ballot for voter
consideration. A utility users’ tax is what is called a “general” tax, which means
that tax revenue received by the City must be spent only on proper local
government activities, and will be used to pay for City services and programs,
such as the types of services and programs described in the Measure language.

At present, the City of Santa Fe Springs does not impose a utility users’ tax. The
proposed ordinance, if adopted, would create a 5% tax on certain types of utility
services in the City. The utility services on which the proposed tax would be
imposed are electricity, gas and communications. The tax would not be imposed
on cable television charges.

Low income service users who are enrolled in a utility service provider’s “CARE”
program would be exempt from paying the tax on that utility service. The
proposed tax measure also provides that no service user will have to pay more
than $20,000 in tax for each individual type of utility service in any fiscal year;
that maximum amount will be increased annually if there are increases in the
Consumer Price Index, beginning in July of 2012.

For passage, a simple majority of all of the voters casting votes on the Measure
must vote “YES”.

Pursuant to State law, the City would not be able to raise the tax rate, or the
maximums except for the inflationary adjustment explained above, without
submitting any proposed increase to the voters for approval.

A “YES” vote is a vote for adoption of the ordinance creating the tax, with the
specific provisions described above. A “NO” vote is a vote against creating the
tax.
