IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE C

This City Council-sponsored measure, if adopted by (2/3) of
East Palo Alto voters voting on the measure, would raise revenue to light
crime through community prevention and law enforcement programs. The
revenue would come from a new special tax, which is proposed to be in
effect for ten (10) years.

California cities may impose special taxes only if (2/3) of a city’s
voters approve the tax. A special tax is a tax that the City can use only for
the purposes specified in the tax measure.

The revenue generated from this tax would be allocated and
expended as follows:

a.	50% for community and neighborhood policing, training,
crime suppression and investigations.

b.	50% for violence prevention services with an emphasis on
youth and families, ex-felons, domestic violence and senior
citizens. Prevention services could be provided by City
agencies or by adding capacity to community-based
organizations.

This measure also requires an annual independent audit and
establishes a ‘Crime Fighting Act Committee’ to review the annual audits,
evaluate the effectiveness of the programs, and make recommendations to
the Mayor and City Council regarding programs and administrative
regulations.

The special tax would be $100.00 for a single family residential
parcel and $75.00 for each unit in a multi-family residential parcel. For
commercial and industrial parcels, the special tax would vary depending on
the frontage and square footage of the property. Owners of undeveloped
parcels are exempt from this parcel tax for each year that they can prove to
the City that their parcel was undeveloped for at least six months of the
year.

Senior citizens over 65 years of age and disabled persons would be
exempt, upon application for exemption.
