CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE P  


Cities and counties may tax persons who stay 30 days or less in motels, hotels, or similar lodgings. Such taxes are called “Transient Occupancy Taxes” (“TOT”). The City of Sebastopol has had a TOT since 1964 (Ordinance Numbers 480 and 681). The amount of that tax is currently set at 6%; the proceeds of the tax go into the City’s General Fund, and may be used by the City for any general government purpose.  During the past year, the City Council completed a study of long term capital equipment and operating needs. Based upon the recommendations of that study, the City Council placed this measure on the ballot to obtain the additional revenue to finance such needs.  Measure P would increase the TOT from 6% to 10%. The additional revenues will also go into the General Fund, usable for any purpose determined by the City Council, and for that reason, Measure P is a “general” tax under Proposition 218, and would be approved by a majority vote at this election.  If so approved, Measure P will become a valid and binding ordinance of the ' City, and will be considered as adopted upon the date that the vote is declared by the City Council. If Measure P is not approved, the existing TOT at 6% will  continue to remain in effect.
