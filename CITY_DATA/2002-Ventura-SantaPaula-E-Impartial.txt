CITY OF SANTA PAULA
IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY*
MEASURE "E"

The City of Santa Paula currently imposes a 10% transient occupancy
tax on guests in hotels, motels, inns or other similar commercial
establishments. In 1986 California voters approved Proposition 62 which
established a voter approval requirement for any increase in general local
taxes. The constitutionality of Proposition 62 was challenged in court
proceedings. A conclusive decision was not made until Santa Clara County
Transportation Authority v. Guardino (1995) II Cal.4th 220 in which the
California Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of Prop. 62. In the
meantime, in 1994 the Santa Paula City Council relying on the decision of
other lower courts that Proposition 62 was unconstitutional increased the
transient occupancy tax from 7% to 10%. Unfortunately, the California
Supreme Court in Guardino did not decide whether its decision would be
applied retroactively. While the court still has not ruled directly on this issue,
it may be inferred from its subsequent ruling in Howard Jarvis Taxpayersâ€™
Association v. City of LaHabra (2001) 25 Cal.4th 809 that voter approval of
the increase is required. Consequently, Measure E is presented to the
voters for approval.

Passage of this Measure would validate the increase in the transient
occupancy tax originally imposed by the Santa Paula City Council in 1994.
