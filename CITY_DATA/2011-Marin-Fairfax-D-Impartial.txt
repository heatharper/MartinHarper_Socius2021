TOWN ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS
OF MEASURE D

Measure D asks the voters to approve an ordinance that
provides for an additional 1/2 cent tax on each dollar of
taxable sales of goods in the Town of Fairfax, and on the
taxable storage, use or consumption in the Town of goods
purchased from a retailer. This is commonly known as a
“sales tax,” and is technically referred to as a “transactions
and use tax.” The tax revenues would be deposited into the
Town’s general fund and could be used for general municipal governmental purposes. The measure would not obligate the Town to use the revenues of the proposed sales tax
for any particular services, facilities, or programs.

The 1/2 cent sales would be in addition to the current sales
tax, and would be collected in the same manner as the
existing sales tax. Presently, the combined state and local
sales tax rate in Fairfax totals 8 cents per dollar. This measure would have the effect of increasing the total sales tax
rate to 8 1/2 cents per dollar in Fairfax.

The proposed sales tax would be subject to an annual independent financial audit that reviews whether the tax is collected, managed and expended in accordance with law.
The Town Council unanimously voted to place this sales
tax measure on the ballot. If approved by a majority of the
voters, the sales tax would go into effect on April 1, 2012
and continue for five years. A full copy of the text of the
sales tax ordinance is printed in these ballot materials.

A “YES” vote on Measure D will enact the sales tax ordinance to increase by 1/2 cent the sales tax rate in Fairfax.
A “NO” vote on Measure D will result in the sales tax
ordinance not being adopted.
