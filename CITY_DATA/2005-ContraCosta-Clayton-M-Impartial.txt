Impartial Analysis from City Attorney

Following public hearing on July 5, 2005, the City Council adopted Resolution No. 33-2005 establishing the Clayton Community Facilities District 2005-1 (CFD), the boundaries of which encompass the entire City of Clayton. The public services and facilities (improvements) proposed to be financed by the CFD are itemized in Exhibit "A" to the Resolution. They include improvement and maintenance of public roadway landscaping and maintenance of the Clayton Fountain, Downtown Park, open space and trails.

In order to pay for maintenance and improvements, related administrative costs, and the debt service on no more than $2,800,000.00 in improvement bonds to be issued, a special tax is proposed in the initial total amount of $365.00 to be levied annually on each residential parcel and non-residential acre not defined as exempt within the District.

The $296.00 services component of the tax may be increased annually by the City Council in an amount not to exceed the full annual adjustment (April to April of the Consumer Price Index-all Urban Consumers, San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose, California area, base period 1982-84 equals 100). The determination to apply any CPI adjustment shall be made by the City Council at a public meeting accompanied by prior recommendations of a CFD Citizens Oversight Committee. The $69.00 debt service component of the tax is not subject to adjustment.

The special tax will be levied annually for a period of 15 years commencing with fiscal year 2006-2007 to and including fiscal year 2020-2021 and then will expire.

The proposed annual appropriations limit has been preliminarily established at $1,616,000.00 (first year budget).

On July 5, 2005, the City Council also adopted Resolution No. 34-2005 deeming it necessary to incur bonded indebtedness in the maximum amount of $2,800,000.00 for CFD improvements, subject to approval by the qualified electors.

On July 5, 2005, the City Council also adopted Resolution No. 35-2005 calling for a special election to be held November 8, 2005 within the CFD (City boundaries) on whether this special tax shall be levied, if the appropriations limit for the District (first year total budget) shall be as set forth above, and if improvement bonds of no more than $2,800,000.00 shall be issued.
