MEASURE "D5‚Äù

Measure "D5" proposes to amend the San Buenaventura Municipal Code in
order to impose a tax of 15% on the gross receipts of lawful cardroom operations
in the City. The tax will be collected quarterly. This tax is in addition to any
business license tax imposed by City regulations.

A 10% penalty will be assessed for each month the tax is delinquent not to
exceed 100% of the tax.

Cardroom operators are required to keep complete records of all transactions
relating to the receipt and disbursement of funds from cardroom operations for
the three-year period prior to remittance of the tax. The City treasurer is
authorized to audit the tax remittances for accuracy.

Except for the tax rate, the San Buenaventura City Council may amend the
legislation proposed by the Measure by 5 affirmative votes upon a finding that
the amendment is necessary to carry out the purpose of the Measure.

The Measure does not amend, delete, or otherwise affect existing regulations
governing cardroom operations in the City.
