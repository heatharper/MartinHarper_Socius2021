IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE I

Under Article of the California Constitution, general law cities, such as the
City of Azusa, are authorized to impose new or increase existing general taxes,
if a proposed new levy or increase is approved by a majority of the voters.

The passage of Measure I by a majority of voters in the City would enact
Ordinance No. 97-013. This ordinance authorizes the City to increase the existing
general tax on residential rental property receipts as follows:

Rental Receipts	Tax

Under $5,000 per year	$100.00

The revenue from the tax increase will generate approximately $96,000. This
measure increases existing taxes and does not establish new taxes. The proceeds
from these taxes will go into the City’s General Fund to replace revenues lost due
to the impacts of Proposition 218. The general tax revenue can be used to finance
all types of general municipal services, including, but not limited to, parks and
recreation, library, senior citizen program, building, planning, public works and
emergency and safety services.

If approved, the measure will add the necessary authorizing provisions to the
Azusa Municipal Code. In the future, the tax rates can only be changed or
increased by a majority vote of the voters. However, the measure will authorize
the City Council to implement any necessary procedures for collection of the
taxes.

A “yes” vote will authorize an increase in the residential rental receipts tax. A
“no” vote will indicate a vote against an increase in this tax.
