BALLOT TITLE:

The 2008 Oakland Police Services Expansion Measure. A Proposed Ordinance Creating A Special Parcel Tax
To Increase Police Personnel and Add A Data Management System

BALLOT SUMMARY:

This measure authorizes a new special parcel tax. This
tax funds additional police personnel costs for the purpose
of maintaining and enhancing police services and programs to prevent crime in the City of Oakland.

Tax revenues must be placed in a special fund and
expended only to:

A.	Increase police personnel as follows:

1.	Add 35 police officers and add 25 police services
technicians in Fiscal Year (FY) 2009-10. (FY is
July 1st through June 30th.)

2.	Add 35 police officers and add 25 police services
technicians in FY 2010-11, cumulatively 70 additional police officers and 50 police services technicians.

3.	Add 35 police officers and add 25 police services
technicians in FY 2011-12, cumulatively 105 additional police officers and 75 police services technicians.

4.	Cover cost of 105 police officers and 75 police
services technicians in each subsequent FY.

B.	Data management system to analyze crime statistics.

C.	Annual audits, evaluation, and engineering.

D.	Cover personnel costs such as recruitment, salaries,
benefits, and training.

The annual tax rate is set as follows:

A.	Per single family residential parcel:

FY 2009-10: $113.42

FY 2010-11: $184.87

FY 2011-12 and each subsequent FY: $275.56
For income parcels are exempted.

B.	Multiple Residential Unit Parcels (per unit):

FY 2009-10: $77.49

FY 2010-11: $126.30

FY 2011-12 and each subsequent FY: $188.26
Owners of units vacant for at least six months may
request a 50% reduction.

C.	For non-residential parcels, the tax is calculated by
multiplying a parcel’s Single Family Residential
Unit Equivalents (“SFE”) times the tax rate. SFE is
based on frontage and square footage, specified in
Ordinance Part 3, Section 2(C).

FY 2009-10: $58.09 per SFE

FY 2010-11: $94.68 per SFE

FY 2011-12 and each subsequent FY: $141.13 per

The parcel tax cannot be imposed unless minimum
staffing requirements are met. Whether the City meets
minimum staffing requirements is determined as follows:

(1)	Each FY the Council determines the number of currently employed police officers (“annual determination”);

(2)	The tax may be imposed for the following FY only, if
the number of police officers currently employed on the
annual determination date meets minimum staffing
requirements; (3) Minimum staffing requirement is 803
officers currently employed on the annual determination
date while the Violence Prevention and Public Safety Act
of 2004 is in effect; otherwise the minimum staffing
requirement is 740 officers.

If the City meets the minimum staffing requirements, it
may impose the FY 2009-10 tax rates. The City can
increase the rate to the FY 2010-11 levels only, if 35 additional offers are currently employed on the annual determination date. The City can increase the rate to the FY
2011-12 level only, if additional 35 officers are currently
employed (cumulatively 70 additional police officers) on
the annual determination date. Once the rates are increased
to the FY 2011-12 rates, rates are effective provided the
minimum staffing requirements are met.
