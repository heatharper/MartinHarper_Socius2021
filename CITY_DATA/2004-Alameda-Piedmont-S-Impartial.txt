Impartial Analysis from Piedmont City Attorney
Measure S is a replacement for the City's current Municipal Services Tax. In 1980 the first Municipal Services Tax was placed before the Piedmont voters and approved, and similar tax measures have been approved every four years thereafter, often by substantial majorities. The intent of each of these tax measures was to supplement the funds generated by real property taxes, sales taxes, and other revenues in order to provide the level of municipal services expected by Piedmont residents.
The Municipal Tax Review Committee comprised of private citizens concluded that there will be a cumulative City deficit of over $2,700,000 by Fiscal Year 2008/09 unless the voters approve a tax increase of 120%. Following the Committee's recommendation, the City Council has placed two measures on the ballot. Measure S would increase the Municipal Services Tax by 90%. Measure T would further increase the current tax by 30%.
Measure S is designed to allow the City to provide police, fire, paramedic, and public works services at a basic level. Measure S will provide $1.8 million each year to be used for police, fire, paramedic, public works and other City services. Without the passage of Measure S, significant personnel reductions, services cutbacks, decreased maintenance of city parks and streets are possible.
For the past 24 years the City has relied on a Municipal Service Tax to provide services which are expected by the City's residents. Passage of Measure S is important if basic City services are to continue.
