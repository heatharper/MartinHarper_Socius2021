CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS
OF CITY MEASURE “A”

Ballot Measure A is a proposal to impose a one percent (1%) transactions (sales)
and use tax on gross receipts of retailers within the incorporated territory of the
City of Trinidad for a period of four years to replenish the General Fund Reserves.

The ordinance imposing the sales and use tax which will be adopted by the City
Council pursuant to Revenue and Taxation Code Sections 7251 et seq. and 7286.24
does not become operative unless Measure A is approved by a majority of the
electors voting on the measure on Tuesday, April 13, 2004.

If the measure is approved, the operative date for the imposition of the sales
and use tax shall be the first day of the calendar quarter commencing more than
110 days after the adoption of the transaction and use tax ordinance, which is
August 2, 2004.

If approved, the City will enter into a contract with the State Board of Equalization
for administration of the tax program as required by the Revenue and Taxation
Code. Upon distribution by the Board of Equalization, the proceeds shall be deposited
into the City’s General Fund Reserves.
