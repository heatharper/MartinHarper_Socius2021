WHEATLAND CITY ATTORNEY
TITLE, SUMMARY AND IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF
CITY OF WHEATLAND TRANSACTIONS AND USETAX MEASURE

Ballot Title: City of Wheatland Transactions and Use Tax (aka sales
tax increase).

The Wheatland City Council proposes to adopt a transactions and
use tax. The City Council approved the tax measure, subject to approval
by a majority of the City voters.

The transactions and use tax would be charged to City retailers
at the time of sale of any goods and on the storage, use or consumption
of goods within the City. The tax would be collected by the State
Board of Equalization at the same time and in the same manner that
the Board collects the ordinary state sales taxes from City retailers.
The Board would return the tax revenue to the City The City would
deposit the revenue in its general fund and use the revenue to fund
general City services (for example, Police Department, Fire
Department, parks and recreation).

The amount of the tax would be one-half of one percent (0.5%),
which is a tax of one cent for every two dollars of goods sold within
the City. If the voters approve the transactions and use tax measure,
it would effectively raise the sales tax that is charged on purchases
of goods within the City by one-half of one percent. The transactions
and use tax would only be collected for ten years, unless the voters
approve another measure to extend the tax.

Under state law, the voters of the City must approve a new City
tax. Accordingly, the City Council is requesting the voters to approve
this tax. It is a general tax and requires majority voter approval.

A “Yes” vote on the measure would be a vote to approve the tax.

A “No” vote on the measure would be a vote against the tax.
