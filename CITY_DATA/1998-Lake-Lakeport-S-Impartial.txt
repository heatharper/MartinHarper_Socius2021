CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS
MEASURE S

Ballot Measure S is a proposal to impose a 3/4
percent transaction and use tax on gross receipts of
retailers within the incorporated territory of the City of
Lakeport for repair, replacement, construction or reconstruction of the City’s streets and road systems and for
an increase in the City’s spending limit so that the
monies collected can be used for such purposes.

The ordinance is adopted pursuant to Revenue
and Taxation Code Section 7286.40 and shall not
become operative unless approved by 2/3 of the electors voting on the measure on Tuesday, November 3,
1998.

If adopted, the operative date shall be the first day
of the first calendar quarter commencing more than 110
days after adoption of the transaction and use tax ordinance.

If adopted, the City will enter into a contract with
the State Board of Equalization for administration of the
tax collection so as to minimize the cost of collection.

Upon collection, the proceeds shall be deposited
into a special restricted fund to be used only for the
repair, replacement, construction or reconstruction of
the City of Lakeport’s streets and road systems.

The tax will end ten years from the date on which it
receives voter approval.

Additionally, if adopted the appropriations limit for
the City would be increased by the amount of the maxi-
mum projected aggregate collection amount authorized
by the imposition of this tax.
