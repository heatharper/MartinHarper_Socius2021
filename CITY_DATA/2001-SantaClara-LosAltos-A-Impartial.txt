Impartial Analysis by City Attorney
City Attorney's Impartial Analysis of Measure A
Measure A proposes to increase the City of Los Altos Transient Occupancy Tax from the present rate of 8% to an amount not to exceed 11%. A tax of 11% or less could be set by City Council resolution. The Transient Occupancy Tax is collected by the operators of hotels in the City from persons occupying space in the hotels. Revenues from the Transient Occupancy Tax are paid into the City's general fund. This fund provides moneys which support all City services. These include public safety, traffic control, maintenance of streets, City facilities and landscaping, and parks and recreation. A yes vote will authorize the City Council to raise the tax rate in an amount which may be up to, but cannot exceed 11%. A no vote will result in a continuation of the 8% rate. The above statement is an impartial analysis of Ordinance 01-403. If you desire a copy of the ordinance, please call the City Clerk at 650 949-1491 and a copy will be mailed at no cost to you.
