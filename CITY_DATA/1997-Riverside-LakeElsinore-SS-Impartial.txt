IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS MEASURE "SS"

Pursuant to California Constitution Article XIII C, Section 2(d), Proposition 218, effective July 1,1997, Measure "SS" proposes to levy
a Special Tax for a six (6) year period commencing fiscal year 1998/99 or certain public safety services according to the following formula:

Tax Category	Annual	Tax	Rate

Single Family Residential	$27.00

Multiple Family Residential	$20.25

Mobile Home Park Residential $13.50
Commercial/Industrial	$108.00 per acre

Vacant Residential	$13.50

Vacant Other	$54.00 per acre

Due to significant budget reductions, funds available for public
safety services decreased approximately $350,000 in the past fiscal year
and there are no funds available to finance the operation and maintenance costs associated with the proposed new West End Fire Station.
In addition, prior to the passage of Proposition 218, the City of Lake
Elsinore collected funds for graffiti removal services through rates
charged in the Lighting and Landscape Maintenance District (LLMD)
established in 1988, with fees set annually by the City Council. Pursuant
to Proposition 218, the City may no longer collect that portion of LLMD
fees used to pay for graffiti removal services without a vote of the
electorate.

Proposition 218 authorizes the City to levy a Special Tax to pay for
these public safety services if approved by a 2/3rds vote of those persons
voting at the election. It is estimated that the levied Special Tax will
generate approximately $900,000 of which: (i) approximately $350,000
will replace General Fund revenues cut from the Cityâ€™s budget for public
safety services; (ii) approximately $40,000 represents revenues lost as
a consequence of Proposition 218 together with an additional $10,000
necessary to effectively provide graffiti removal services, and (iii) approximately $500,000 represents new funds that will be allocated to the
operation and maintenance of the proposed new West End Fire Station.

The City services to be funded and percentage of tax proceeds to
be allocated to each service are as follows:

Services	Percent	of Tax Proceeds

(Dollar Amount)

Police	33%

Fire	55%

Structure Abatement	6%

Graffiti Removal	6%

Since this is a Special Tax, in order to be effective, it must be
approved by a 2/3rds vote of those electors voting in this election.
Likewise, the percentage allocations of tax proceeds may be used only
as authorized by the electorate and tor no other purpose. After six (6)
years, the Special Tax proposed by Measure "SS" cannot be levied
without approval of 2/3rds of the electors voting in a future election.
