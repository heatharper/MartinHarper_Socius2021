IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE A

The Cityâ€™s existing transient parking tax, adopted by the Burbank City
Council on December 12, 1995, is imposed on people who pay for short
term parking in the City at parking facilities such as at the airport, a
hotel, an office building or a conference center. The rate is 10% of the
parking fee.

The tax does not apply to monthly residential or employee parking nor
does the tax apply to parking at hospitals or medical facilities. The tax
has no effect on those who do not pay to park. The tax does not increase
or add to property taxes paid by Burbank property owners.

The revenues from the tax are available for general, local purposes including,
but not limited to, fire protection, law enforcement, parks, libraries, criminal
prosecution, capital improvements and other authorized uses.

The tax generates revenues of approximately $1,650,000 per year for
the City. A public report of an independent audit of revenues collected
shall be reported annually to the news media.

This ballot measure is proposed in response to Proposition 218, which
was approved at the statewide election on November 5, 1996 and requires
that any local tax imposed, extended or increased after January 1, 1995,
be approved by the voters.

If a majority of the votes cast on this ballot measure are "Yes", this
measure will be approved, continuing at the same rate, the tax that is
currently in effect. If a majority of the votes on this measure are "No",
the measure will not be approved and the transient parking tax will no
longer be collected. In that case, the estimated future annual revenues
of $1,650,000 will not be available for general local purposes.
