

CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS

The City Council has authorized the placement of a proposition on the ballot seeking voter
approval of a measure that would amend the San Diego City Charter and the San Diego Municipal
Code to raise the Transient Occupancy Tax [TOT] from the current rate of 10.5 percent to 13
percent. The TOT is a tax paid by hotel and motel guests who reside for one month or less in a
hotel or motel in the City. Because the revenues derived from raising the TOT rate would be used
for general governmental purposes, and because the increase will be implemented by an
amendment of the City’s Charter, this measure is a general tax which will take effect if passed by a
simple majority of City voters.
