CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE Q

Cities may levy retail transactions (“sales”) and use taxes in accordance with
the procedures and requirements of the Transactions and Use Tax Law (Part
1.6 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code). The City of Sebastopol
has received the necessary authorization from the State Legislature to levy a
Transactions and Use Tax in the City at a rate of 0.125% for general revenue
purposes (Revenue and Taxation Code section 7286.80).

The City Council has placed this measure on the ballot to obtain additional
revenue to finance, among other things, long term capital equipment and
operating needs identified in the Revenue Enhancement Study which was
completed this year.

The ordinance which would be approved by this measure would levy the
proposed sales and use taxes at the rate of one-eight of one percent (0.125%)
on retail sales, and storage, use or consumption of personal property, in the
City of Sebastopol, as more fully described in the language of the proposed
ordinance. Certain exemptions would apply which are also identified in the
ordinance.

This measure must be approved by two-thirds (2/3) of the Sebastopol electorate
voting at this election. If so approved, Measure Q will become a valid and
binding ordinance of the City, and will be considered as adopted upon the date
that the vote is declared by the City Council.
