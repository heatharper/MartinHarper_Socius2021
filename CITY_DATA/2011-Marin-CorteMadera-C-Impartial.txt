TOWN ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS
OF MEASURE C

If this measure is approved by the requisite two-thirds
vote, an ordinance shall be adopted in the Town of Corte
Madera imposing a special tax to pay for paramedic and/or
emergency medical services (EMS). This is not the first
time an EMS tax has been submitted to and approved by
the Town’s voters. A special EMS tax was first approved
by the Town’s voters on June 7, 1983, and was last
approved by the Town’s voters in November 2006. The tax
expired on June 30, 2011. Voter approval of this measure
is required in order to continue the provision of EMS services at existing levels.

If approved, this measure will impose a yearly tax for
EMS services for the current and the next three fiscal
years. A “fiscal year” runs from July 1 of one year through
June 30 of the next year. For fiscal year 2011-2012, the tax
amount will be $60,000 for each residential unit. For non-residential uses, the tax rate for fiscal year 2011-2012 will
be $60.00 per 1,000 square feet of enclosed floor area.
This is the same EMS tax rate that was in effect in fiscal
year ending June 30, 2011. The tax rate on residential and
nonresidential uses may increase $5.00 per year for each
of the remaining three years the tax is in effect as necessary to meet annual expenditures of providing EMS services. These annual increases are not automatic. They
must be approved by the City Council at a public meeting
on an annual basis.

The measure provides that the tax proceeds must be
separately accounted for and may only be used for the provision of EMS services. The measure also provides that
the EMS tax will be collected by the Marin County Tax
Collector along with and subject to the same rules applicable to the ad valorem property tax. The tax will automatically terminate on June 30, 2015.
