Impartial Analysis from City Attorney

A transient occupancy tax is collected for the privilege of occupancy of hotel rooms. The tax is collected from transient occupants of hotel rooms by hotel operators and remitted to the City.

This measure, if approved by two-thirds of the voters voting on the measure, will increase the authorized transient occupancy tax rate in steps over a period of five years beginning January 1, 2005 from the current rate of 7.25% to a maximum rate of 10% on January 1, 2009.

The measure if approved would also designate .75% of the rate as a special tax that will be annually appropriated for economic development purposes. The remaining amount of the tax rate would be available for general city government purposes. If the measure is not approved the existing 7.25% transient occupancy tax rate will remain in place as a general-purpose tax.

The measure, to increase the transient occupancy tax, as set forth in Ordinance No. 366, will continue to primarily fund general municipal services such as police, road maintenance, park maintenance, and recreation services. The special purpose portion of the tax, which is .75% of the rate, will be designated for economic development purposes. The special tax purpose portion of the tax must be placed in a special fund and can only be used for these purposes and incidental expenses related to these purposes.

The measure calls for the transient occupancy tax to increase over time as follows:
8.0% - January 1, 2005 through December 31, 2005
8.5% - January 1, 2006 through December 31, 2006
9.0% - January 1, 2007 through December 31, 2007
9.5% - January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2008
10.0% - January 1, 2009 and thereafter

The measure also provides for the City Council to conduct a public hearing in the November prior to each scheduled tax increase commencing with the increase of January 1, 2006, and unless the increase is deferred by the City Council, the rate increase will become effective on January 1st of the following year.
