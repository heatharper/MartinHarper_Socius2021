IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY TOWN ATTORNEY
MEASURE C

The ballot measure presented is whether the Town of Ross
shall levy a municipal services tax for four years from July 1,
2000, to June 30, 2004, in the manner provided in the ordinance
to be voted on and to thereby increase the Town's appropriations
limit to fund general governmental services.

The ordinance provides that each year during the budget
adoption process, the Town Council shall determine the total
amount of expenditures necessarily to provide adequate levels of
municipal services or capital improvements and to deduct
therefrom the projected revenue to be gathered from sources
other than the proposed municipal services tax. Once that
amount is determined, the Town Council shall, within the
maximum limits set within the ordinance, determine the total
amount to be raised by the proposed tax and apportion the tax
among all improved parcels of real property or utility users within
the Town limits.

The ordinance provides for notice and public hearing before the
adoption of the tax; its inapplicability to use of property legally
exempt from tax; allows for additional exemptions by resolution;
sets forth the manner of collection and the increase of the
appropriations limit required to fund the tax.
