IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY

Measure E would authorize the Kingsburg City Council to enact an ordinance imposing a two percent
(2%) utility users tax within the City. This measure was placed on the ballot by the Council at the express
public request of local Kingsburg citizens.

Measure E is a general tax measure expressly authorized by Article 13C, § 2 of the California Constitution
and Sections 53723 and 53724 of the California Government Code. If the measure is supported by a
majority of those voting, the City Council would be authorized to enact the approved ordinance imposing
the tax for general City purposes. The text of the approved ordinance on file with the City Clerk
describing the method of imposition and collection applies the tax at a rate of two percent (2%) on the
amount charged for electric, gas, telephone and cable television utility services delivered to the City
users, to be paid by the customer and collected by the utility providers. The ordinance would become
effective no sooner than January 1, 2001 and authorizes the City Council to provide exemptions from
the tax, including those which may be needed for low income/lifeline users.

A “Yes” vote authorizes the City Council to enact the approved utility users tax ordinance. A “No” vote is a vote against that action.
