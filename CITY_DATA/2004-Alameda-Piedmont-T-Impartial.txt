Impartial Analysis from the Piedmont City Attorney
Measure T is a supplementary parcel tax which will increase City revenue and help ensure that Piedmont city government continues to operate at its current service level. It is a companion tax to Measure S and cannot be passed unless Measure S is also passed.
Voters may choose to reduce City services to a very basic level of services by passing only Measure S or they may choose to preserve current services levels by passing both Measure S and Measure T. Measure T will provide $300,000 each year which is needed to maintain current service levels. Although no one can state with certainty which City services will be reduced without this tax, failure to raise these funds will cause changes in the operation of the City.
This situation may be further impacted by the loss of state revenues from Vehicle License Fees. This major loss of revenue was not taken into account by the Municipal Services Tax Committee. The City Finance Director estimates that this could cost the City approximately $450,000 each year and would increase the projected City deficit by $1,800,000 over the next four years.
Measure T cannot be passed without Measure S. Voters wishing to continue City services at their current level must vote for both measures. Without the passage of both measures, the City may well be forced into very significant reductions in City services.
