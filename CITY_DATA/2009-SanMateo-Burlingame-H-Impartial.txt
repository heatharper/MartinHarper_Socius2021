Impartial Analysis of Measure H	Argument In Favor of Measure	H

The City Council of the City of Burlingame has placed this measure
on the ballot to ask the voters of Burlingame to approve an amendment
to the City’s transient occupancy tax ordinance to increase the transient
occupancy tax rate from the current 10% to 12%. The transient occupancy
tax is that tax placed upon the room rent charged to hotel guests in the City
of Burlingame. Hotels in Burlingame collect the tax from hotel guests as
part of charge to be paid by the guests for occupancy of their hotel room.

The City estimates that the increase of the transient occupancy tax
from 10% to 12% would generate approximately $2 million dollars per
year. Because the transient occupancy tax is a general tax and not a special
tax, the additional revenue generated would be deposited into the City’s
general fund for general governmental purposes, such as police, fire,
library, recreation, planning and administration services, and the repair
and improvement of city streets and other infrastructure, including the
Broadway/Highway 101 interchange.

Because the additional tax revenue would be used for general City
governmental purposes, a simple majority vote of those persons voting on
the measure is required to approve the measure. And, because the tax would
be adopted by a vote of the people, the tax rate could not be increased again
unless approved by another vote of the people.

A YES vote approves the measure.

A NO vote rejects the measure.
