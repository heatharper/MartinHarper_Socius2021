Impartial Analysis by City Attorney

Watsonville enacted a Transient Occupancy Tax in 1964.  That tax is found in Section 3-6.303 of the Watsonville Municipal Code and it provides that a general tax equal to ten percent (10%) of rent shall be charged on room rent of thirty days or less.  For example, if a hotel room costs $75.00 per night, the transient occupancy tax is $7.50. 
This measure would change existing law by imposing a special tax of an additional one percent (1%) which would be segregated in a “Conference and Visitors Promotion Fund” and could be used to promote tourism only in Santa Cruz County.  For example, if a hotel room cost $75.00, an additional $.75 would be charged for a total of $8.25. 
Under this measure, the City would also be required to contract annually with the Santa Cruz County Conference and Visitors Council, a non-profit corporation established in 1988 to promote tourism in Santa Cruz County.  The contract obligation would depend on the Visitors Council satisfactory performance of approved goals and independent assessments which would occur every three years. 
Under this measure, the Visitors Council would be required to prepare and submit an annual accounting of all expenditures made with Conference and Visitors Promotion Fund monies, and also make its books and records available for review by the City’s Administrative Services Director for examination or audit upon reasonable notice.  The Visitors Council would also be required to provide annual reports demonstrating achievement of goals related to tourism in the City of Watsonville and Santa Cruz County.
In order to be adopted, the Measure must be approved by 2/3 of the voters voting on it.
