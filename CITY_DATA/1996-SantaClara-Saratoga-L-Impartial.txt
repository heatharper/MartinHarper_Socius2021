CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE L

A. SUMMARY OF MEASURE

This measure continues the City of Saratoga's existing utility users tax at the same tax
rate currently in effect, until January 1,2001, at which time the tax would expire, unless
extended beyond January 1, 2001 by a further vote of the people

B. EXISTING LAW

On April 3, 1985 the City established a utility users tax for the purpose of raising
revenues for the general governmental purposes of the City. The tax is imposed on
users of electricity and gas. The tax rate of 3 and one-half percent (3 1/2%) was
established in 1985 and has remained unchanged.

The 1985 utility users tax contained a “sunset clause” which would have
automatically repealed the tax after the expiration of five years. The tax was not
automatically repealed since the sunset clause was replaced in 1989 with a second five
year sunset clause. That sunset clause was replaced in 1995 with a third five year sunset
clause. The third sunset clause, which is still in effect, continues the tax until July 1,
2000, at which time the tax would be automatically repealed.

C. EFFECT OF THE MEASURE

This measure would amend the existing sunset clause, thereby continuing the tax at
the same tax rate of three and one-half percent (3 1/2%) until January 1, 2001 at which
lime the tax would expire unless it was continued beyond that date by a vote of the
people.
