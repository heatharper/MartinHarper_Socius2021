CITY ATTORNEYâ€™S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF
UTILITY USERS TAX MEASURE J

Under Chapter 13.52 of the City of Richmond Municipal Code,
the City of Richmond currently levies a tax on users of telephone
(including cellular telephone), electric, gas and video (including both
cable and satellite) service within the City equal to 8% of the charges
for such, services. This tax is collected by the providers of these
services on their regular bills and the revenues are transmitted to the
City. The tax revenue is used for the general governmental purposes of
the City and is not restricted or earmarked for any particular purpose or
expenditure. Large users of these utility services may elect to pay a
maximum flat tax amount rather than the 8% amount. The maximum
flat tax amount for the current fiscal year is $1,301,595.00 for every 1%
of the tax payable (or $10,412,763.00, based on the 8% tax rate in
effect currently). This maximum flat tax amount is increased for inflation
based on an index as provided in the Richmond Municipal Code.

This Measure, if approved by a majority of the voters voting on
the Measure, would increase the rate of this utility tax from 8% to 10%
The tax would continue to apply to the same utility services as are
currently taxed and revenue from the tax would continue to be available
for the general governmental purposes of the City and would not be
restricted or earmarked for any particular purpose or expenditure.
