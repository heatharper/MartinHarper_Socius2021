CITY ATTORNEY'S ANALYSIS OF THE NEVADA CITY FIRE
DEPARTMENT TAX MEASURE

This measure would raise revenue to be used specifically to
purchase and renovate fire houses, fire trucks, and other fire
equipment, only. The revenue could not be used for maintenance
or salaries.

The tax would be on a per parcel basis and the Fire Department estimates that this measure would generate approximately
$20,000.00 per year in revenue. Each single family home would
be taxed $12.00 per year and all other residential units would be
charged $8.00 each per year. Commercial units would be taxed
based on the total size of all of the commercial buildings located on
the parcel. The annual tax for commercial structures would vary
from $50.00 for the smallest structures to a maximum of $250.00
per year when the commercial units on the parcel exceeded 50,000
square feet in size.

In order for this measure to become low, it will require
approval by two-thirds of the Nevada City voters voting at the
November election. By voting for this measure, the voters will also
be authorizing that the Governmental Spending Limitation imposed on Nevada City by Article XII IB of the Constitution be
raised by the amount of revenue generated. At the present time,
the City is well below its spending limitation, but it may reach that
limit in future years.
