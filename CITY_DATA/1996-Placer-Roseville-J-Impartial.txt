Roseville currently has a Hotel Tax for (he privilege of occupying a room
in any hotel in the City. The amount of the tax is currently set at six
percent (6%) of the rental charged by the hotel operator. The tax is paid
by the person renting the hotel room. Thus, Roseville residents who do
not utilize any of the hotels in the City will not be impacted by this
measure. The tax is collected by the hotel operator as a part of the bill
or the room rental. The six percent rate was established in 1975, and
has not been increased since.

This measure would amend the Roseville Municipal Code to raise the
amount of the Hotel Tax collected to ten percent (10%) of the room
charge. Placer County and other surrounding cities have similar measures on the ballot. If all are approved, then a uniform rate of ten percent
will apply to all hotels in the South Placer County area.

The revenue generated from the Hotel Tax is placed in the City's General
Fund, and is used to pay for a variety of public facilities and services.
