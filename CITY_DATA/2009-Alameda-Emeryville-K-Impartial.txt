Impartial Analysis from Emeryville City Attorney
The purpose of this measure is to adopt an ordinance increasing the existing business license tax imposed on persons engaged in the business of operating, conducting or managing a card room in the City of Emeryville to provide for general municipal services. Under Proposition 218, adopted in 1996, proposed tax and fee increases must be placed on the ballot for voter approval.

Currently, the business license tax imposed on card room businesses is the greater of nine percent (9%) of gross receipts or $1,000.00 per approved card table, paid on a monthly basis. Under the proposed ordinance, the business license tax imposed on card room businesses would be increased to the greater of ten percent (10%) of gross receipts or $1,000.00 per approved card table, paid on a monthly basis.

A YES vote will increase the business license tax imposed on card room businesses to the greater of ten percent (10%) of gross receipts or $1,000.00 per approved card table, paid on a monthly basis.

A NO vote will not increase the business license tax imposed on card room businesses; however, the present business license tax imposed on card room businesses, which is the greater of nine percent (9%) of gross receipts or $1,000.00 per approved card table, paid on a monthly basis, will remain in effect.
