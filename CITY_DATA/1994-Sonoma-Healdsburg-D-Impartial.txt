CITY ATTORNEYâ€™S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE C

Measure C is submitted to the Electorate of the City of Healdsburg (the "City")
for an advisory vote.

Under current state law, general law cities, including the City of Healdsburg,
may create an assessment district for the purpose of maintenance of parks and
recreation facilities. While the action described in Measure C may be initiated
under state law without the voter approval, the City Council has resolved to submit
the consideration of such action to an advisory vote of the city electorate.

Therefore, this measure which is ADVISORY ONLY, if passed, would have no
effect on existing law and would not be binding on the council members. It would,
however, constitute an expression of the desire of the voters that:

-They support the formation of an assessment district providing for real
property assessments in the amount of not to exceed S7.25 each month, to
provide for the maintenance and repair of city parks, sport and school fields
and recreational facilities; and

-The city would, if such an assessment were imposed, review it annually; and
-The assessment, if imposed, would end five (5) years, or sooner, after imposition.

The purpose of this assessment district is for the maintenance and repair of
the city parks and recreational facilities, including, but not limited to, the city pool,
museum, senior center, and boys and girls club.

The imposition of this assessment would also carry with it the corollary power
to use reasonable means to effect collection.
