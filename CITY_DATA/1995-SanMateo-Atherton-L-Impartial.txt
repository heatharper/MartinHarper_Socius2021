CITY ATTORNEY IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE L

This Initiative Measure proposes to add a new ordinance to the
Ordinance Code of the Town of Atherton that would allow the City
Council to continue to impose a Special Tax on Real Property to
finance Municipal Services, such as police protection, street repair
and maintenance, drainage facility repair and maintenance, building
regulation, and park maintenance where other sources of revenue are
not sufficient because of restraints imposed by Article XIIIA of the
California Constitution also known as Proposition 13. The ordinance
would correspondingly increase the appropriations limit under
Article XmB of the California Constitution.

City Council must conduct duly noticed public hearing on proposed
tax after adoption of annual budget. Tax may not exceed the total
amount of expenditures necessary to provide adequate levels of
municipal services, as determined by the City Council, after deduct-
ing the projected revenue to be gathered from sources other than the
Special Tax.

Tax on individual parcels may not, however, exceed in any year the
following amounts:

1996-97 1997-98 1998-99 1999-00

1. For each dwelling on a parcel with an area of less than 1/4 acre;	450	450	450	450
2. For each unimproved parcel with an area of 1/4 acre;	225	225	225	225
3. For each dwelling on a parcel with an area of 1/4 acre or more, but less than 1/2 acre:	570	570	570	570
4. For each unimproved parcel with an area of 1/4 acre or more, but less than 1/2 acre;	285	285	285	285
5. For each dwelling on a parcel with an area of 1/2 acre or more, but less than 2 acres:	750	750	750	750
6. For each unimproved parcel with an area of 1/2 acre or more, but less than 2 acres:	375	375	375	375
7. For each dwelling on a parcel with an area of 2 acres or more:	960	960	960	960
8. For each unimproved parcel with an area of 2 acres or more:	480	480	480	480
9. For each private club:	3825	3825	3825	3825
10. For each parcel available for tax owned by a utility which serves the Atherton community:	450	450	450	450

11. For each parcel
available for tax
owned by a utility
which does not
directly serve the

Atherton community:	750	750	750	750


Tax will be a lien on individual parcels and may be collected by the
Town or the County Tax Collector at the option of the City Council.

Any monies raised by this Special Tax may be used only for said
municipal services. In accordance with Article XIIIB of the
California Constitution, all revenues received in a fiscal year and the
fiscal year following it in excess of the Townâ€™s appropriations limit
during that fiscal year and the fiscal year immediately following it
shall be returned by a revision of tax rates or fee schedules within the
next two subsequent fiscal years.

Authority to levy this tax will commence with the tax year 1996-97
and will expire with the tax year 1999-2000, and may only be
amended or repealed by a two-thirds vote.

MAXIMUM TAX IN GIVEN YEAR
