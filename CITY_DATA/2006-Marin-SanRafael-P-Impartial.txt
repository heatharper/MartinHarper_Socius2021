CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS
OF MEASURE P

This measure would authorize amendment of the San
Rafael Municipal Code to increase the maximum rate of
the City’s Paramedic Service Special Tax on residential
units and non-residential structures. The total increase
could not exceed $24.00 per unit for residential units, and
$.03 per square-foot for non-residential units.

Currently, the maximum Paramedic Tax rate is $61.00
per unit for residential structures and $.08 per square-foot
for non-residential structures. The paramedic tax will
remain at these levels should this measure not be approved
by the voters. Contrary to the intended purpose of the
Paramedic Tax ordinance, the current maximum paramedic
tax rate fails to fully fund the paramedic service program.
The City’s General Fund currently subsidizes the
Paramedic Service Program by approximately $450,000.00
each year.

If adopted, this measure would authorize phased
increases to the current maximum Paramedic Tax from
$61.00 up to $85.00 per unit for residential units and from
$.08 per square-foot up to $.11 per square-foot for non-
residential structures. This measure would also increase
the appropriations limit for the City of San Rafael for four
(4) years (2007/2008 through 2010/2011) by the total
amount collected under this tax so as to enable the City to
expend the money collected, as authorized by Article
X111B of the California Constitution.

This measure prohibits the City Council from setting
the Paramedic Tax rate above the limits authorized. It also
prohibits the City Council from expending any tax revenue collected under it for any purpose other than the San
Rafael Paramedic Service Program.

The ordinance amendments proposed by this measure
will be adopted if approved by a two-thirds majority of
those electors voting on the measure.

A YES vote approves the measure.

A NO vote rejects the measure.
