CITY ATTORNEYâ€™S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE F

Chapter 3.16 of the Newark Municipal Code and City Council Resolution
No. 6107 provide for a tax payable by persons occupying a hotel or motel room
in Newark at a rate of seven and one-half percent (7.5%) of the room rate. The
7.5% rate has been in effect since approved by Newark voters at the election of
November 6, 1990. The hotel/motel operator collects the tax from guests.
Persons who stay in the hotel or motel longer than thirty (30) consecutive days
are exempt from the tax. Hotel/motel operators pay the tax to the city every
three months.

This tax is not a special tax, but is a general tax deposited in the general fund
for general government purposes. It is not a tax upon real property. Because it
is a general tax and not a tax involving real property, it may be increased by a
simple majority vote. As required by state-wide Propositions 218 and 62, such
a tax may only be imposed or increased by a vote of the people at a regular
municipal election.

Measure F amends City of Newark Resolution No. 6107 to increase the tax
rate from 7.5% to 10% of hotel/motel room charges effective January 1, 2002. t
For example, under the current rate, based on a $75.00 per night hotel/motel
room, the guest pays a room tax of $5.62 per night. If passed, Measure F would
increase that tax by $ 1.88 to $7.50 per night.
