Impartial Analysis from San Leandro City Attorney
The San Leandro City Council has placed a measure on the November 2, 2004 ballot asking voters to adopt an ordinance that would allow the City to impose a special tax on real property owners to help fund police and fire protection services within the City.
If approved by the voters, this tax would be collected from property owners annually. The amount of the tax varies depending on a property's use as follows:
	•	Commercial/Industrial  $16.00 per thousand square feet
	•	Residential-Single Family  $78.00
	•	Residential Multi-Family Mobile home  $46.80 per unit
	•	Unimproved  $4.00 per thousand square feet
	•	Non-profit education Places of worship  $13.00 per thousand square feet
	•	Exempt  $0.00 
The City Manager may adjust these tax rates annually by the percentage increase, if any, in the Consumer Price Index.
The ordinance provides that the City will adopt administrative guidelines to assist in implementing this tax. The administrative guidelines will address how the taxing category for mixed-use property will be determined, address procedures to allow lower income senior citizen residential property owners to apply for a tax reduction, and will address matters related to the interpretation and enforcement of the ordinance.
The ordinance provides a claims procedure for requesting a tax refund, and imposes penalties for untimely or unpaid taxes.
This tax is a special tax. If approved by the voters, this special tax becomes effective on January 1, 2005. The ordinance will be repealed 5 1/2 years after the effective date unless previously extended by the voters. The ordinance specifies that proceeds from this special tax may only be used to fund police and fire protection services as that term is defined in the ordinance. As this tax is a special tax, it requires a "yes" vote of two-thirds of the voters to pass.
