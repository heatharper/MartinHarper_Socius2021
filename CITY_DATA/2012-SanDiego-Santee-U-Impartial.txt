CITY ATTORNEY'S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE U

The City of Santee currently imposes 6% general tax on rent charged by the operator of any
hotel or similar lodging in the City of Santee for guests staying fewer than thirty days. This tax is
called the Transient Occupancy Tax ("TOT') and is collected by hotel operators at the time rent is
paid by the guests. The City's TOT was established in 1981 and the amount of the TOT has not
changed since its establishment. All funds collected from the TOT are deposited into the City's
General Fund.

Measure U proposes the adoption Of an Ordinance of the City of Santee which would (1) increase
the TOT from 6% to 10%; (2) amend certain definitions to clarify that the TOT applies to
campsites, online travel companies, and may apply to the first thirty days of an occupancy longer
than thirty days; and (3) require a person who seeks to challenge the assessment or collection of
the TOT to first pay the TOT and follow certain administrative procedures before filing a lawsuit.

The proposed TOT is a general tax and may be used for any general governmental purpose of
the City, such as law enforcement and fire protection; crime, gang, and drug prevention; street
maintenance; graffiti removal; and maintenance of parks and sports fields. In order for the City to
adopt the Ordinance amending its Municipal Code and authorizing the increase in the rate of the
TOT described above, Measure U must be approved by a majority vote of the votes cast on the
measure.

A "yes" vote on Measure U would adopt the Ordinance described above.

A "no" vote on Measure U would mean that the Ordinance described above is not adopted.
