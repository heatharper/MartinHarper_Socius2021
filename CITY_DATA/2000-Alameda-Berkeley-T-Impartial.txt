Currently the maintenance and installation of streetlights in Berkeley are funded by a city-wide assessment district. Proposition 218, adopted by the voters in
November 1996, prohibits an increase in this assessment. This ordinance would
authorize a special tax of 0.260 per square foot of improvements on residential
land, 0.520 per square foot on industrial land and 1.040 per square foot on commercial land to supplement the existing assessment. These tax rates may be
adjusted by the Council by the increase in the cost of living in the immediate
San Francisco Bay Area, or personal income growth in the state of California,
whichever is greater. The City Council may repeal this ordinance, or amend it
in a manner that does not result in an increase in the tax imposed herein, without further voter approval. If the City Council repeals this ordinance, it may
subsequently reenact it without voter approval, as long as the reenacted ordinance does not result in an increase in the tax imposed herein.

Financial Implications

The proposed City special tax rate would limit the annual cost for an average

1,900	square foot home to $4.94. If the tax is not passed. Council may have to
cut funding of other general fund programs, such as police, fire, and senior and
youth programs to free up the necessary funds for streetlight maintenance and
installation.

It is estimated that the tax will cost residential taxpayers no more than the following average amounts during FY 2001-02

Square Feet	Annual 1
1,200	$ 3.12
1,500	$ 3.90
1,900	$ 4.94
3,000	$ 7.80
10,000	$26.00
