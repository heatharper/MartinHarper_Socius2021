IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY THE CITY ATTORNEY
MEASURE J

The Sausalito Municipal Code currently imposes a Transient Occupancy
Tax rate in the amount of 10% for the privilege of occupancy in any
hotel, inn, tourist home or house, apartment house, dormitory, public or
private club, mobile home or house trailer at a fixed location, or other
similar structure occupied for thirty days or less for dwelling, lodging or
sleeping purposes within the City. The proposed measure would amend
the Municipal Code to increase the Transient Occupancy Tax rate from
10% to an amount not to exceed 12%.

Monies received from the Transient Occupancy Tax are deposited into
the general fund and may be used for any lawful purpose. In order to
increase the tax rate, State law requires that a majority of the voters
voting in this election approve this measure.

This measure does not automatically raise the Transient Occupancy Tax
to the maximum level authorized. Rather, if the measure is approved the
City Council will adopt a resolution setting the tax level which could not
exceed 12%.

This measure would also increase the appropriations limit for the City of
Sausalito by the total amount collected under this tax so as to enable the
City to expend the money collected, as authorized by Article XIIIB of the
California Constitution.
