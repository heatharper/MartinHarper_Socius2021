
CITY ATTORNEY'S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE D

City Charter Section 608 (c) currently establishes that while City ordinances
generally become effective thirty (30) days after adoption, City ordinances
declaring the amount of money necessary to be raised by taxation, or fixing the
rate of taxation, or levying the annual tax upon property, or providing for a
tax levy for the current expenses of the City, become effective immediately
upon adoption. This measure amends this section of the City Charter to conform
with state law by specifying that such ordinances declaring the amount of money
necessary to be raised by taxation or fixing the rate of taxation may be
adopted and will become effective upon adoption only if those kinds of
ordinances are allowed under state law. This measure further deletes ordinances
levying the annual tax upon property from the list of ordinances that become
effective upon adoption.
