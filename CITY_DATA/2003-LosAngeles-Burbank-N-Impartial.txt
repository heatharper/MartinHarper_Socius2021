IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE N

The Cityâ€™s existing transient parking tax is imposed on people who pay for
short term parking in the City at parking facilities such as at the airport, a
hotel, an office building or a conference center.

The tax does not apply to monthly residential or employee parking nor does the
tax, apply to parking at hospitals or medical facilities. The tax has no effect on
those who do not pay to park. The tax does not increase or add to property
taxes paid by Burbank property owners.

The current tax rate is 10% of the parking fee. This measure would amend
Section 14-1903 of the Burbank Municipal Code to allow the City Council to
increase the tax up to a maximum of 12%, after a public hearing on the matter.
If this measure passes, the City Council could adjust the rate of the tax from
time to time, but can never increase the tax above the 12% cap without
additional voter approval.

The revenues from the tax are available for general, local purposes including,
but not limited to, fire protection, law enforcement, parks, libraries, criminal
prosecution, capital improvements and other authorized uses.

If a majority of the votes cast on this ballot measure are "Yes", this measure will
be approved, allowing the City Council to increase the tax rate up to a
maximum of 12%. If a majority of the votes on this measure are "No", the
measure will not be approved, and the transient parking tax will continue to be
collected at the existing rate of 10%.
