

CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE C

This Measure would amend the City of Alameda Municipal Code. The
Measure would amend the Chapter of the Municipal Code that permits the use
of assessment districts for “public improvements of a local nature” and sets out
the procedure that must be followed to establish an assessment district. The proposed amendment would specifically list construction of a building or buildings
and the acquisition of property for library and Carnegie museum purposes as a
public improvement of a local nature. The proposed amendment also provides
that listing such uses in the Code shall not be construed as a limit or restriction
on the use of the City’s assessment district procedure for other public improvements of a local nature.

If approved, the amendment would explicitly permit the City Council to begin proceedings to form an assessment district to finance construction of a new
main library and seismic upgrade and rehabilitation to the Carnegie library for
museum purposes. Although the proposed Measure would not require the
Council to begin the process for forming an assessment district for these purposes, the City Council has adopted a resolution declaring its intention to do so
if the proposed amendment to the Municipal Code is approved by the voters.

A “yes” vote would approve the proposed amendment to the City of Alameda
Municipal Code.

A “no” vote would disapprove the proposed amendment to the City of
Alameda Municipal Code.
