CITY ATTORNEY'S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS
BUSINESS LICENSE TAX MEASURE D

The City of Brentwood has proposed amending its business license
tax and regulations to amend its Business License Tax and Regulations, as
set forth in the Ordinance No, 707.

On February 24, 1948, the Brentwood City Council adopted
Ordinance No.2, which provided for the issuance of business licenses.
While being one of the oldest ordinances, the fees have not changed since
1948, except, to place a surtax of twenty percent to subsidize the Brentwood
Chamber of Commerce In fiscal year 1948-1949, the Business License fee
generated approximately $9,785, In fiscal year 2,000-2001, 1521 business
license fees generated revenue of $73,943, but administration costs were
approximately $72,230.

The current Business License fee is based on a flat fee, plus a per
employee or unit charge, not to exceed S60 per year plus a 20% surcharge
paid to the Brentwood Chamber of Commerce. An application fee of $25 or
a late fee, if applicable, are not included in the Business License fee.

The City of Brentwood proposes that its business license fee and its
regulations be (1) comparable to adjacent cities, such as Pleasanton,
Antioch, and Livermore; (2) provide for a equitable basis and rate; (3) require
all businesses to pay a business license fee; (4) provide a consistent
general fund revenue for such vital services as police services; and (5)
establish updated regulations and fees so it will not be difficult or costly to
administer and for the business community to understand as well.
