The City of Hercules does not presently have a mechanism for taxing paid admissions tickets to sporting events, theatrical performances, motion pictures or other special events. The proposed ordinance would

permit the city to impose a tax of 5% of the price on each ticket for admission to any stadium, theater
or motion picture theater within City limits. The admission tax would apply to professional and
amateur or occasional sporting events and to all theatrical performances, motion picture presentations
or other special events for which an admission is charged. The proposed ordinance exempts from the
tax (1) Operators of athletic teams that have five-year or longer leases with the City, (2) operators or
sponsors of all-star athletic contests where the entire proceeds go to charity, (3) athletic teams sponsored by a school district or by a community college district, (4) use of stadiums by non-profit elementary or secondary schools, attendance at which satisfies the requirements of California laws pertaining to compulsory education, (5) charitable athletic contests or other special benefit events for which there is no private benefit and (6) sporting and entertainment events operated by the City
Permits for conducting covered events must first, be obtained from the Hercules Director of Finance
and operators must post either money or a qualified sufficient to cover the estimated amount of
the tax due.
