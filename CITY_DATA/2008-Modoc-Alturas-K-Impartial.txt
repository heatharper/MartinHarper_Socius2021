IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
CITY OF ALTURAS MEASURE K

Measure K would authorize the City to implement
and impose a special 1/2 percent transactions and use
tax (sales tax) within the city limits of the City of Alturas
to provide supplemental funding for law enforcement, fire
protection and other public safety purposes. Passage
of Measure K would not result in funds collected from
the sales tax being used to replace regular public safety
funding from the city general fund.

Funds collected would be placed in a special
account separate from the city general fund. Use of funds
collected from the supplemental sales tax would be limited
to authorized public safety expenditures as set forth in a
Program Guidelines and Public Safety Expenditure Plan
as adopted by the City Council. Expenditures would be
subject to audit by a Citizensâ€™ Oversight Committee that
would be made up of members of the community selected
by the City Council.

Passage of Measure K would authorize the City
of Alturas to contract with the State Board of Equalization
for purposes of collecting the sales tax. Ordinance
Number 476 was passed and adopted on August 5, 2008
at a special meeting of the City Council. If Measure K
is approved by a double majority vote of the residents
of the City of Alturas at the Statewide General Election
held November, 2008, the ordinance would impose the
supplemental sales tax effective ten days after certification
of the vote count by the City Clerk.
