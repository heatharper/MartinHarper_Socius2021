CITY ATTORNEY'S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS
OF PROPOSITION 97-B

(Parking Tax)

The Parking Tax is a tax on the rent for every
occupancy of parking space In a parking station which
occurs in the City of Inglewood. It is commonly referred to
as a “visitor oriented” tax since the burden of the tax falls
on the user of the parking space, often a visitor to the City.
The tax has been in effect since 1972.

In September 1996, the City Council increased the
tax from 5% of the amount charged for space rental to
10%. The increase was not intended to go Into effect until
July 1, 1997. It is expected to result in an increase in
revenues of approximately $300,000 annually.

in November 1996, the voters of the State of
California amended the Constitution by adding Article
XIIIC §2 (c), which requires that any taxes increased
between January 1, 1995 and November 6, 1996 be
approved by a majority of the voters before it can continue
to be imposed. The Parking Tax increase adopted by the
City Council in September 1996 is therefore required to
obtain voter approval.

This measure seeks to obtain voter approval of the
increased Parking Tax in order to comply with the new
provisions of the California Constitution.
