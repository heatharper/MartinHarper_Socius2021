CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE V


Cities may levy retail transactions (“sales”) and use taxes in accordance with the
procedures and requirements of the Transactions and Use Tax Law (Part 1.6 of
Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code). The City of Sebastopol has
received the necessary authorization from the State Legislature to levy a
Transactions and Use Tax in the City at a rate of 0.125% (from the current 7.5%,
to 7.625%) for general revenue purposes (Revenue and Taxation Code section
7286.80).

The ordinance which would be approved by this measure would levy the
proposed sales and use taxes at the rate of one-eighth of one percent (0.125%)
on retail sales, and storage, use or consumption of personal property, in the City
of Sebastopol, as more fully described in the language of the proposed ordinance.
Certain exemptions would apply which are also identified in the ordinance.

This measure must be approved by a majority of the Sebastopol electorate voting
at this election. If so approved, Measure V will become a valid and binding
ordinance of the City, and will be considered as adopted upon the date that the
vote is declared by the City Council.
