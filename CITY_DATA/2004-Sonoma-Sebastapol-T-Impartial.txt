CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE T

Cities may levy retail transactions (“sales”) and use taxes in accordance with the
procedures and requirements of the Transactions and Use T ax Law (Part 1.6 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code). The City of Sebastopol has received
the necessary authorization from the State Legislature to levy a Transactions and
Use Tax in the City of Sebastopol at a rate of one-fourth of one percent (0.25%), for
general revenue purposes (Revenue and Taxation Code section 7286.80).

The ordinance which would be approved by this measure would levy the proposed
sales and use taxes on retail sales, and storage, use or consumption of personal
property, in the City of Sebastopol, as more fully described in the language of the
proposed ordinance. Certain exemptions would apply which are also identified in
the ordinance.

Passage of Measure “T” will repeal the previous tax measure passed by the electorate in 2002, so that the sales and use tax rates in the City of Sebastopol will
henceforth be as stated in the first paragraph of this analysis. If Measure “T” is
not approved, then the current increase in the sales and use tax rates, established
in 2002, of one-eighth of one percent (0.125%), will not be repealed, and will continue in effect.

This measure must be approved by a majority of the Sebastopol electorate at this
election. If so approved, Measure “T" will become a valid and binding ordinance of
the City, and will be considered as adopted upon the date that the vote is declared
by the City Council.
