IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE U

Ballot Measure U presents the voters with the option of ratifying the City’s
existing 10% transient occupancy tax and increasing such tax by 4%. The
transient occupancy tax is paid by persons who stay at hotels in the City and not
by property owners.

The City last adjusted the rate of the transient occupancy tax in 1990. That year,
the City Council adopted an ordinance increasing the amount of the tax from 6%
to 10% of the rent charged by the hotel operator. Although the City has
collected the transient occupancy tax from hotel guests at the 10% rate from
1990 to the present, recent court decisions now forbid the City from continuing
to impose the tax at that rate without voter approval.

This Measure, if adopted, would constitute a formal approval by the voters of the
City Council’s 1990 increase of the transient occupancy tax and the City’s
subsequent collection of the tax at the 10% rate. This Measure, if adopted, also
would amend Westlake Village Municipal Code Section 6.4.020 to increase the
transient occupancy tax by 4%. Such increase would allow.the City to collect the
tax at the rate of 14% in the future. Such re-adoption additionally would enable
the City Council to reduce the tax, and to otherwise adjust the tax to any rate less
than or equal to 14%, without further voter approval.

This Measure, if adopted, would not allow the City Council to increase the rate
of the transient occupancy tax in excess of 14% without voter approval. If this
Measure and Measure T (which also relates to the City’s transient occupancy
tax) are both approved by the voters, then the provisions of this Measure would
take precedence over Measure T.

A “yes” vote on Measure U enacts an ordinance ratifying the City’s existing 10%
transient occupancy tax and increasing such tax by 4%. A “no” vote reduces the
transient occupancy tax to its pre 1990 rate of 6%.
