IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
MEASURE U

The City of Farmersville Revenue Measure, Part 1, approves a one-
half cent increase to the Transactions and Use Tax (“sales tax”)
within the City of Farmersville. The increase will result in local sales
tax being raised from 7.25% to 7.75%. The tax would be collected at
the same time and in the same manner as existing sales taxes.

The revenues from the increased sales tax are not designated for any
specific purpose, and may be used for general City functions, such as
police protection, fire services, and street and park maintenance and
repairs. If approved by the voters, the sales tax will be adopted by
ordinance to become effective no sooner than January 1, 2005.

The sales tax increase is expected to generate approximately
$175,000 per year, which would assist the City with replacing general
fund revenues lost in previous years due, in part, to significant State-
level funding cuts to local government.

If the Farmersville Revenue Measure, Part 1, is defeated, the City
would be required to decrease general fund expenses for the 2004-
2005 fiscal year in the anticipated amount of $43,700, and following
years, in the anticipated amount of $175,000 annually. These
reductions would adversely impact City programs including police, fire

and park maintenance; and may result in the elimination of
approximately 3 police officer positions within the City.

A “Yes” vote on the Farmersville Revenue Measure, Part 1, will
approve an increase in the local sales tax from its current rate of
7.25% to 7.75%. A “No” vote will maintain the City’s current 7.25%
sales tax rate.
