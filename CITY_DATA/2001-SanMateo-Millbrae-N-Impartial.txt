IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE N

The City Council of the City of Millbrae placed this measure on the
ballot to authorize the continuation of the 2% increase in the transient
occupancy tax rate from 8% to 10% that was enacted by the City Council in
1991. The transient occupancy tax, commonly known as the “Hotel Tax,” is
placed on the room rent charged to guests in hotels or motels located in
Millbrae. The tax is collected by the hotels as part of the room bills.

The City estimates that the Hotel Tax revenues from this 2% increment
generate approximately $950,000 per year. These revenues go into the City’s
general fund for general governmental purposes to support police, fire, public
works, parks and recreation, library, code enforcement, and capital
improvements in the City.

The City Council submits this measure to the electorate to ensure that
the current 10% tax rate is in compliance with state law, as recently
interpreted by the California Supreme Court. Because the revenues from
the Hotel Tax are placed in the City’s general fund for general City
government purposes, a majority vote of the City’s voters voting in this
election is required to approve the measure. If the measure does not pass,
the Hotel Tax would be reduced to 8%.
