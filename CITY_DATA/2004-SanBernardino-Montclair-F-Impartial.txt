IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE “F”

This ballot measure proposes a general purpose tax that requires a simple majority vote for adoption. If
approved by the voters, it would enact a one quarter of 1 percent (0.25%) transactions and use tax rate in
the City of Montclair. This tax will add 25 cents to each $100 of taxable sales.

The proposed transactions and use tax, like the current sales tax, would be imposed upon the sale of all
tangible personal property sold at retail within the City of Montclair, as well as upon the storage, use, or
other consumption of tangible personal property purchased from any retailer within the City of Montclair. If
this measure is approved by the voters, the combined sales tax and transactions and use tax rate will be 8
percent. The proposed tax rate would be applied equally to residents and nonresidents making retail
purchases in the City of Montclair.

During its first year of operation, the proposed transactions and use tax is expected to generate
approximately $2.5 million in revenue.

Revenues generated from the proposed transactions and use tax would be deposited into the City's General
Fund to be used by the City of Montclair for general City operations and services, including, but not limited
to, construction of a new Police facility and senior and youth centers, park development, street and sidewalk
repairs, construction of overpasses at railroad crossings, traffic congestion mitigation, and maintenance of
municipal services.
