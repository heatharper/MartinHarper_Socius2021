CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE A

The City Council has authorized the placement of a measure on the ballot
seeking voter approval to raise the City of Palmdale Transient Occupancy Tax,
more commonly known as the “hotel/motel tax” or “bed tax”, from the current
rate of 7 percent to 10 percent.

The Transient Occupancy Tax is charged to persons who occupy hotel or motel
rooms within the City of Palmdale and is usually added to the room rates
charged. This tax is a percentage of the hotel or motel room charge and is not
applied to other services, such as catering, banquets, conference rooms and food.
The tax is not charged to residents of the City of Palmdale unless they stay in
hotel or motel rooms in the City.

The revenues derived from raising the Transient Occupancy Tax rate would be
used for general governmental purposes, therefore this measure is a general tax
which will take affect if passed by a simple majority of the City voters.
