BACKGROUND

The City of Auburn currently levies an 8% Transient Occupancy Tax
(TOT), often called the hotel/motel tax. This is a general fund tax
imposed upon the occupant of a hotel, motel or similar establishment.
On July 6 1996. the City Council voted to submit to City voters the
question of whether the transient occupancy tax should be increased
from its current rate of 8% to a new rate of 10%.

ANALYSIS

Unlike a special tax where the revenues generated can only be used for
a specified purpose, revenues generated from the transient occupancy
tax may be placed in the City's general fund and are available for any
public purpose deemed appropriate by the City Council. It is anticipated
that approval of an increase in the transient occupancy tax rate from the
present 8% to 10% will generate additional general fund revenue.

EFFECT OF VOTE ON MEASURE R

If Approved by the Voters

If Measure R is approved by a majority of voters, the city ordinance will
be amended to increase the transient occupancy tax rate from 8% to
10%.

If Not Approved by the Voters

If Measure Ft is not approved by a majority of voters, the transient
occupancy tax rate will remain at its current rate of 8%.
