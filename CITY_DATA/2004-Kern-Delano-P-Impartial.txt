IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
CITY OF DELANO
MEASURE P

This ballot measure, if adopted by the voters, would enact a temporary ten-year
one-half of one percent (1/2%) increase to the sales tax rate in the City of Delano.
'The sales tax is also referred to as a “transactions and use tax ” The current sales
tax rate in the City of Delano is seven and one-quarter percent (7.25%). Accordingly, if this ballot measure is adopted, the sales tax rate would increase to
seven and three quarter percent (7.75%) for the next ten years. The proposed increased sales tax, like the current sales tax, would be imposed upon the sale of all
tangible personal property sold at retail within the jurisdictional limits of the city as
well as upon the storage, use or other consumption of tangible personal property
purchased from any retailer in the jurisdictional limits of the city.

All revenue generated from the proposed sales tax increase would be deposited
into the city’s General Fund and accordingly, all monies collected pursuant to the
sales tax increase would be used by the city to pay for general city operations and
services. As such, this ballot measure proposes a “general purpose tax” rather
than a “special purpose tax” and requires a simple majority vote for adoption.

This wording applies to Measure P.
