IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE A

This proposed Measure, if passed by the voters of the City of Commerce, will
enact a “Hotel Visitor Tax” in the City, effective January 1, 2006. This tax will
not be paid by residents of the City of Commerce. The tax will be paid by persons
using any hotel, inn, motel or other such establishment [collectively “hotel or
motel”] within the City for a period of 30 consecutive calendar days or less.

The tax is twelve percent (12%) of the rent charged by the operator of any hotel.
The operator collects the tax at the same time the hotel visitor pays the rent for
the room. The operator then pays the tax over to the City.

The funds raised by the tax paid by the hotel visitors will go into the general fund
of the City and will be used for general municipal services, such as public safety,
the repair and maintenance of City streets and other City improvement projects.
For example, such funds can be utilized to pay for any or all of the continued
increase in operational costs for police services ($4,682,424 budgeted for FY
2005-06), fire services ($6,756,499 budgeted for FY 2005-06), City library services
($2,614,009 budgeted for FY 2005-06), City Parks & Recreation facilities and
services ($8,514,732 budgeted for FY 2005-06), as well as various street repair
and improvement projects, amongst other things.

In order to pass, the proposed Measure must receive Yes votes from a majority
of those voting on the Measure.

The passage of the proposed Measure will not result in additional costs to the
City of Commerce. The Measure will have no effect on the City’s existing laws.

If the proposed Measure is not passed by the voters, no tax will be levied on the
hotel visitors within the City.
