IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE T

The City of Brisbane imposes a general business license tax which is
based upon annual gross receipts. The proceeds of the general tax can be
used for any municipal purpose. For a business having annual gross
receipts of $10,000,000 or more, the general tax would be $1,300 plus 40
per $1,000 of gross receipts over $10,000,000. Measure T will amend the
City’s business license tax to establish a special tax that would apply only
to businesses having annual gross receipts in excess of $10,000,000. The
proceeds of the special tax can be used only for the acquisition,
construction, installation, maintenance, repair or replacement of capital
improvements owned or to be constructed or acquired by the City. “Capital
improvement” is defined as any asset having an acquisition, construction,
or installation cost of $25,000 or more and a useful life of 10 years or more.

The amount of the special tax is 7 per $100 of annual gross receipts
of persons subject to the tax, reduced by the amount of general business
license taxes paid by that person and further reduced by the amount of any
sales tax paid by that person during the same year. For example, a company
with gross receipts of $10,000,001 would be charged a special tax of
$7,500 ($10,000,000 - 100 = $100,000 x .075 = $7,500). The same
company would owe a general business license tax of $1,300 (based upon
the existing tax ordinance), which would be offset against the special tax.
Consequently, the total owed would be $1,300 as a general tax plus $6,200
($7,500 less $1,300) as a special tax, for a combined total of $7,500. If that
same company also paid $5,000 in sales tax, such amount would be applied
as a direct credit against the special tax, reducing total business tax liability
to $2,500. In no event would the credits for sales taxes reduce the general
business license tax below the existing minimum payment of $1,300.

The combined total of the general business license tax and the special
capital improvement tax cannot exceed $10,000 for the calendar year 2009,
$22,500 for the calendar year 2010, and $35,000 for the calendar year
2011. Thereafter, the limit of $35,000 is subject to annual adjustment based
upon the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index. Consequently,
a business having gross receipts in excess of $10,000,000 would never pay
less than $1,300 or more than the specified limit on the combined total of
general and special business license taxes during any single tax year.

Because it is a special tax that may only be used for the purpose of
financing capital improvement projects, Measure T requires a two-thirds
vote for passage. A “Yes” vote is a vote in favor of the special tax and a
“No” vote is a vote against the special tax.
