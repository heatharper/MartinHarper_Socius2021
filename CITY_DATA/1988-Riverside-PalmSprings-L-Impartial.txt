

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE L

Pursuant to the provisions of Elections We Section 5011, the
following is submitted as impartial analysis of City Measure L to appear
on the ballot at the election to be held November 8, 1988.

MEASURE L

Shall the Business License Tax rates established by
Ordinance No. 1257, adopted February 19,1988, amend-
ing Chapters 3.84 and 3.90 of the Palm Springs Municipal
Code, be continued in full force and effect after November
15, 1988; and shall the appropriations limit imposed by
Article XIII B of the California Constitution be increased in
amounts equivalent to the proceeds of the Business
License Tax?

The City of Palm Springs has levied a business license tax since
1938. In February, 1986, the rate structure of such tax was revised
and increased, in three stages, to the level now being charged. The
increased rates of tax may not continue to be imposed after November
15, 1988, unless approved by majority vote of the voters voting in an
election on the issue of imposition.

If a majority of the voters vote in favor of the measure, the business
license tax will continue indefinitely at the same rates as are currently
being charged, and the appropriations limit of the City pursuant to
California Constitution Article XIII B will be increased in amounts
equivalent to the proceeds of the Business License Tax.

If a majority of the voters vote against the measure, the business
license tax will revert to the rates in effect prior to February, 1986. The
fiscal effect of reverting to the former rates would be a reduction of
revenue to the City of Palm Springs estimated at $150,000 each year.
