MEASURE “O”

ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY

On May 13, 1996, the Upland City council passed its Ordinance No. 1628, thereby
establishing a charge on real property located within the City of Upland to generate funds
to maintain the City’s storm drain system.

The charges established by the passage of Ordinance No. 1628 are as follows:

Four dollars and twenty-five cents ($4.25) per month for each detached single family
residential unit;

Three dollars and fifty cents ($3.50) per month for each dwelling unit in apartments, duplexes,
condominiums, trailer parks, mobile home parks and similar multi-family residential parcels;
and

An amount per month for each non residential parcel based on the amount of water runoff
attributable to that parcel, with a minimum monthly charge of $4.25 and a maximum monthly
charge of $30.00.

If passed, the measure will enact an ordinance which would amend Ordinance No. 1628 by
reducing the storm drain system maintenance charges established by Ordinance No. 1628
to “$0", thereby eliminating those charges. The elimination of the charges will eliminate a
source of funds used to maintain storm drains through the provision of, among other things,
tree trimming and street sweeping services.
