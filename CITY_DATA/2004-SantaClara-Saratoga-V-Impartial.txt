This measure would establish a Utility Users Tax in the City of Saratoga. The tax would be imposed on telephone, electricity, gas, water, and video services. The tax rate would be 4%. The proceeds from this tax would be deposited in the City’s general fund and used for general governmental purposes. The tax would remain in effect for ten years.  The measure provides for certain exemptions. Low-income persons, eligible to participate in the CARE and Lifeline utility discount programs would be exempt from paying the tax on the utility services to which those programs apply (gas, electric, and some telephone services). The measure gives the City Council the authority to establish other classes of exemptions from the tax. Various service providers are exempted from paying taxes on their own utilities. The City is exempted from all taxes. The measure allows the City Council to reduce the tax rate. Any increase in the tax rate would require voter approval.  According to information provided to the City by utility service providers, this tax could increase the City’s general fund revenue by about $2.6 million per year. Detailed information concerning the City's budget is a matter of public record and is available at City Hall.  A "yes” vote on this measure would establish a Utility Users Tax at a  rate of 4%.  A “no" vote on this measure would result in no change in the level of taxation.  This measure must receive a majority of "yes” votes in order to pass.
