Impartial Analysis from County Counsel

Ballot Measure T proposes several changes to the City of Pleasant Hill's existing utility users tax.
A 1% utility users tax on telephone service in Pleasant Hill has been in place since 1983. Measure T would amend the existing ordinance to apply to all types of communication and video services so that all communications users are subject to a tax regardless of the technology used. Measure T would also amend the existing utility users tax to apply to electricity, gas, water and sewer services.
Measure T would increase the current 1% rate to 1.5%. This is a maximum rate that cannot be increased without voter approval.
Measure T provides exemptions for low-income or disabled persons through existing programs including PG&E's California Alternate Rates for Energy (CARE) program, the Lifeline Program provided by Contra Costa Water District and the lifeline service set by the California Public Utilities Commission's Lifeline Telephone Program. The City Council would have the ability to adopt incentives or rebates for those who reduce their gas, electricity and water usage.
Revenues collected from Measure T may be used to fund general city services and operations, such as emergency response, police services, road repair and maintenance, flood control measures, and maintenance of library hours. The City will be required to perform an annual audit to ensure that the revenues collected have been properly expended.
Measure T requires approval of a majority of the voters. A "yes" vote on this measure will adopt the changes described above which modernize, update and expand the utility users tax. A "no" vote is against adopting the ordinance.
