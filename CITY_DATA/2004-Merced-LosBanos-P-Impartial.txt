CITY OF LOS BANOS
MEASURE P
CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS

Measure P authorizes the City Council, if approved by two thirds of the qualified voters
of the City, to levy a one half cent special transaction (sales) and use tax within the City
of Los Banos. The one half cent special transaction (sales) and use tax would be paid
at the same time and in the same manner as existing sales taxes and would become
effective April 1,2005.

The revenue raised from the special transaction (sales) and use tax will be used in the
City of Los Banos to: hire and equip; 6 additional firefighter/emts; 3 additional police
officers; additional police support staff including, 2 additional community services
officers and 1 additional police crime analyst. Revenues raised from the special
transaction (sales) and use tax will also be used to: purchase specialty fire safety
equipment including upgrades to “SCBA” breathing apparatus; and to purchase a
911/mobile display computerized dispatch system to dispatch emergency and routine
police and fire calls. Revenues raised from the special transaction (sales) and use tax
will also be used to establish a fund for upgrades and new construction of police, jail,
fire, and related training facilities.

A Citizen’s Oversight Committee will be created to review the revenues generated and
expenditures made from the special transaction (sales) and use tax and report twice a
year to the City Council. Revenues generated from the special transaction (sales) and
use tax will not be deposited into the City’s general fund but shall instead be deposited
into a special account earmarked for specific police, fire, and public safety purposes as
set forth in the Measure. Revenues generated by the special transaction (sales) and
use tax will not be used to replace general fund expenditures or to fund, the salaries
and benefits of existing personnel or other positions not specifically created by the
Measure.
