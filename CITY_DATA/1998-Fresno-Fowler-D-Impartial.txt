IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY

There currently does not exist within the City of Fowler a City imposed tax upon utilities. This
proposition, if approved by a majority of the voters voting on it, will authorize the City of Fowler to
impose taxes upon users of electricity, gas, and telephone service within the City of Fowler. The tax rate
will be as follows:

•	Five percent (5%) upon residential users of electricity and gas based upon monthly charges for the
electricity and gas service.

•	Three percent (3%) upon commercial, industrial, and agricultural users of electricity and gas based
upon monthly charges for the electricity and gas service.

•	Five percent (5%) upon ail users of telephones based upon monthly charges for the local telephone
service. The telephone tax will not be imposed upon long distance services provided by the
telephone user’s long distance carrier or upon cellular services.

The tax will be effective January 1,1999 and automatically terminates on January 1, 2006. The City
Council may elect to terminate the tax sooner.

The tax will be implemented through Ordinance 98-2 approved by the City Council on July 21,1998. The
revenue collected from the Utility User's Tax will be placed into the City’s general fund which can be used
for general municipal purposes.
