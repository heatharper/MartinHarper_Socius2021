Impartial Analysis of Measure U	

The measure proposes a local one-half cent Transactions and Use tax
(sales tax) on purchases made in the City of San Carlos or assessed as
allowed by law in addition to existing sales taxes. The additional one-
half cent sales tax would commence April 1, 2010 and continue for six (6)
consecutive years. An extension of this tax would require City Council
action and a new vote of the public.

The proposed one-half cent sales tax is a general tax and as such, the
funds received from the tax will be placed in the general fund of the City
of San Carlos for City programs, general City functions, or in any manner
allowed by law as directed by the City Council. Examples of such general
fund expenditures could include police, fire services, street maintenance,
parks and recreation programs and capital improvements.

This initiative requires a majority vote (fifty percent plus one) to pass.
