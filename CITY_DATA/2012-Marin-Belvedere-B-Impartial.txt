

CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF
MEASURE B

City of Belvedere
Fire and Emergency Medical Services
Appropriations Limit Adjustment

This ballot measure authorizes the adjustment of the
City of Belvedere’s appropriations limit under Article
of the California Constitution for the period of July
1,2012, through June 30,2016, to allow for the continued
expenditure of the approved annual fire protection and
emergency medical services tax, adopted by the City’s
voters in 2000.

The maximum amount that may be derived from this
levy cannot exceed the rate authorized by Chapter 3.28 of
the Belvedere Municipal Code. The amount of the levy for
the 2011-2012 fiscal year is $605 per residential dwelling
unit, $690 per occupancy in commercial structures, and
$122 per vacant parcel.

Adoption of this measure will increase the City’s
appropriations limit to the extent of the proceeds derived
from the levy for the next four fiscal years. Article
of the California Constitution requires this adjustment of
the appropriations limit be approved by a majority of the
electors voting on the measure on June 5, 2012.

A “Yes” vote on this measure authorizes the City to
adjust its appropriations limit and thus to continue expenditure from its approved levy for fire protection and emergency medical services for four more years commencing
July 1,2012.

A “No” vote on this measure prohibits the City from
adjusting its appropriations limit and thus from expending
the proceeds derived from its approved levy for fire protection and emergency medical services after June 30,
2012.
