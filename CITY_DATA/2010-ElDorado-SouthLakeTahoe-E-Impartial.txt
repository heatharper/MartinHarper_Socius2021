Impartial Analysis

Passage of Measure E will reduce the business license tax on
95% of businesses in the City of South Lake Tahoe by 10%. The
Measure increases the maximum any business pays from $3387
(adjusted for inflation each year) to $10,000 based on the tax rate
for each type of business. The $10,000 maximum will be adjusted
for inflation annually by resolution on or about July 1st by an
amount equal to the lesser of 3% or the change in the San
Francisco/Oakland All Urban Consumer Price Index published by
the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, or any successor to that index,
the prior calendar year. The Measure will increase revenues to the
City that may be used for police, fire, snow removal, paramedics,
parks and recreation, roads and other essential services.

Businesses pay business license taxes per $1,000 of gross receipts
pursuant to the Schedule Classifications as set forth in Section 15-
29 as enacted by Resolution by the City Council from time to
time.

Schedule A: $1.08 Schedule B: $1.62 Schedule C: $2.16 Schedule
D: $2.70

Measure E will reduce the Schedules by 10% as of July 1,2011:

Schedule A: $.97 Schedule B: $1.46 Schedule C. $1.94 Schedule
D: $2.43

Description of each Business and Professions classification for
each Schedule is listed in Section 15-29 of the City Code,
available online at www.cityofslt.us or at the City Clerk's office
during normal business hours.

The passage of Measure E will assist most businesses in reducing
their tax burden. For instance, a retail store's tax rate will be
reduced from 1.08 per $1,000 of gross receipts to .97 per $1,000
of gross receipts. For a business with $1,000,000 annual gross
sales, their business license tax would be reduced from $1,080 to
$970 per year. A retail store's gross sales must be in excess of
$3,500,000 per year to pay more than the business is currently
paying in business license taxes. A store's gross retail sales would
have to be approximately $10300,000 before the business would
pay the $10,000 maximum.

If Measure E passes, the projection is the revisions to the tax rates
will increase revenue to the General Fund of the City an estimated
$101,593 per year. The measure is a general tax increase on
certain business and requires a majority vote to pass. If the
measure fails, the current business tax license rates shall remain in
the effect.
