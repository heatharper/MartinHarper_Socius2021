IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
MEASURE


Measure Y would continue an existing Municipal Services Tax that has been collected in Piedmont since 1980 Every four years thereafter, the voters have approved extensions of the
tax.

Revenue from the Municipal Services Tax goes to the City's General Fund and therefore
can be used to fill gaps when residents' demand for city services exceeds the funds generated by
real property taxes, sales taxes and other revenue. The General Fund provides Piedmonters with
basic services such as police and fire protection, street maintenance, building regulations, library
services, recreation, parks maintenance, planning and public works.

Measure X does not increase the current tax rate or change the procedure for setting the
rate; it merely extends the life of the tax for another four years to June 30, 2017 The tax rate
would continue to vary by parcel depending on the size and the nature of a parcel’s use (i.e,
residential/commercial) Advanced notice and a public hearing would continue to be provided
before the City Council sets the annual tax rate.

The Municipal Service Tax must be used locally and will undergo annual financial

review

A “Yes” vote on Measure Y means the voter is in favor of continuing the existing tax.

A “No” vote on Measure Y means the voter is opposed and the existing tax would no

longer be collected.

Two-thirds (66%) of the qualified voters casting a vote in favor would approve Measure
