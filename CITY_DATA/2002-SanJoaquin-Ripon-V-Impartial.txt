IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE V

Prepared by the City Attorney

Since 1964, the City of Ripon has collected a
transient occupancy tax, also known as a “bed tax" from hotel
patrons or “transients” (those persons occupying hotel rooms
within the City of Ripon for fewer than 30 days). The transient
occupancy tax has been imposed at a rate of 4% of the cost
of the hotel room since 1964. The "transient” pays the tax to
the hotel, and the hotel remits the tax to the City of Ripon.
The City of Ripon deposits transient occupancy tax revenue
into its General Fund, which supports a number of City
services, including public safety, police, health and safety,
administrative and economic development functions. A
complete description of the transient occupancy tax is located
in Chapter 3.16 of the Ripon Municipal Code.

Measure V proposes to increase the amount of the
transient occupancy tax from its current rate of 4% to a new
rate of 10% of the cost of the hotel room. Since a transient
occupancy tax is deposited into the City's General Fund, it is
considered to be a “general tax”. Proposition 218 requires that
general tax increases receive voter approval. If a majority of
the voters vote in favor of Measure V, the transient occupancy
tax in the City of Ripon will increase from 4% to 10%.
