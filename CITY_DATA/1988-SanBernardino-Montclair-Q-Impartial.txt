

ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY

BACKGROUND

Existing taw requires that anyone engaged in business in the City of Montclair must obtain
and pay a fee for a business license for the privilege of conducting business in the City.
The law provides a system for assessing and collecting such business license fees and
requires that a schedule of rates shall be established by resolution adopted by the City
Council.

The existing Business License Fee Schedule was adopted by resolution of the Montclair
City Council on July 21, 1986. However, California state law requires that the resolution
be voted upon by the electorate of the City of Montclair prior to November 15, 1988.

PROPOSAL

This measure requests voter approval of existing law with respect to City of Montclair
business license fee rates. The operational effect of this measure would be identical to that
resolution of the Montclair City Council, presently in effect, establishing business license
fee rates.

If approved by the voters of Montclair, this measure will require each business operator
to continue obtaining an annual business license at rates fixed by resolution in 1986. If this
measure fails to receive voter approval, business license fee rates wilt return to 1967 rates.
This measure affects no operational feature of existing law other than the schedule of rates for business licenses.

FISCAL EFFECT

The existing business license fee rate schedule has been in place for over two years. This
measure requests continuation of this rate schedule. Voter approval of this measure will
not result in any increased taxes to residents or business operators, and will not result in
any additional municipal costs. Failure to approve this measure will result in an annual loss
of approximately $75,000 to the City of Montclairâ€™s general operating fund.
