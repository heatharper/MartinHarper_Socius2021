CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF PROPOSITION 98-B
(Transient Occupancy Tax)

The Transient Occupancy or Hotel Tax is a tax on a person for the occupancy of any hotel or motel room which
occurs in the City of Inglewood. It is commonly referred to as a “visitor-oriented” tax since the burden of the tax falls on the
occupant of the hotel or motel room, often a visitor to the City. The tax has been in effect since 1973.

The proposed Ordinance will increase the tax from 12% to 14% and is expected to result in an increase in revenues
of $266,000 annually. This increase would bring Inglewood’s tax in line with those charged in neighboring localities.
