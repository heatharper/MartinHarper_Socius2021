
CITY ATTORNEYâ€™S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE G

Piedmont voters have regularly supported its Municipal Services Tax
since 1980. The Municipal Services Tax revenues have been used to supplement
other sources of City revenue, particularly in order to maintain police, fire and
other important services at a high level.

As happens every four years, the City Council has placed the renewal of
the Municipal Services Tax on the ballot, but in doing so has reduced the maximum tax rates by 10% from that currently in force. This will result in savings
to Piedmont taxpayers for the coming year, although based on the recommendation of the Municipal Tax Review Committee, maximum rates will be tied in
future years to the Consumer Price Index.

It is difficult to predict the actual financial impact of the Municipal
Services Tax on individual taxpayers over the entire four year period that the
new Tax will be in effect. Every year the City Council carefully analyzes what
the total expected revenues received by the City will be in the next fiscal year
and, based on that, sets the actual amounts of the Municipal Services Tax. The
City Council has frequently decided not to charge the maximum rate that they
could charge, which has reduced the tax paid by homeowners.
