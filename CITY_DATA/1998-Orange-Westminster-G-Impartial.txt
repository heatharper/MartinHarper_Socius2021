CITY OF WESTMINISTER
IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
MEASURE G

The voter approval of the business license tax is the result of the
adoption of Proposition 218, which required general taxes which go in
to the general fund of the City of Westminster to be approved by a
majority of those voting in a general election. This measure if adopted
approves the continuing existence of a tax that has existed on businesses for many years.

Businesses have been required to pay for a business license for
doing business within the City of Westminster. The license rates would
remain at the same level as they currently exist.

This is a tax on businesses only and the tax rate, if affirmed,
approves the tax rate-established by the City Council of Westminster in
1995. The business license rate for retail business assessed against the
gross income of a business. There are different rates for other types of
businesses.

Generally, most cities in Orange County have such a business
license for which they assess businesses within their communities.

The current economic impact to the City of Westminsterâ€™s general
fund from revenue from business licenses is projected to be in excess
of $800,000 annually. If this measure is not adopted the funds would no
longer be received and the general fund would be reduced by this
amount and the city budget modified accordingly.
