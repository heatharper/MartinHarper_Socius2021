CITY ATTORNEY'S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE P

Currently, the City of Oroville imposed a nine percent (9%) transient occupancy tax
on the guests of hotels, motels and like-kind establishments doing business in the
City.

On June 15,2004, the City Council of the City of Oroville approved Ordinance No.
1701 amending Code section 24-104 by increasing the amount of transient
occupancy tax from nine percent (9%) to twelve percent (12%). The transient
occupancy taxes paid by the guests of motels, hotels and like-kind establishments
within the City.

According to the City Finance Director, if this measure is approved by the voters, it
would result in approximately $9,000 of additional revenue to the City per year. All
revenues generated by the tax increase would be deposited in the City's general
fund and would be allocated for general municipal purposes.

A yes vote on this measure by a majority of the voting electors is necessary for the
ordinance to become effective.
