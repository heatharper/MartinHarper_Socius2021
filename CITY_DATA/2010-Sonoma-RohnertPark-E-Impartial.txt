CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE E

California Revenue and Taxation Code section 7285.9 authorizes the City Council
of the City of Rohnert Park to levy a General Transactions and Use Tax (i.e. sales
tax) if the ordinance proposing the tax is approved by a two-thirds vote of all
members of the City Council and the tax is approved by a majority vote of the City's
voters.

Measure E proposes to enact a one-half of one percent (0.50%) increase to the
sales tax rate on purchases made in the City of Rohnert Park. The proposed tax
would be in addition to existing sales taxes and would be collected at the same time
and in the same manner as other sales taxes. Measure E would continue for a
period of five (5) years from the date of commencement. Any extension to the duration of the proposed tax beyond five (5) years would require action by the City
Council and a new vote of the public. The measure requires a majority vote (i.e. 50
percent plus one) to pass.

Measure E is considered a general tax under state law. As a result, if adopted, the
revenues received from the tax would be placed in the City’s general fund and
could be used in any manner authorized by law and as directed by the City Council.
Accordingly, all monies collected could be used by the City to pay for general City
operations and programs such as police and fire services, street maintenance,
park and recreation programs, and capital improvements.

A yes vote on Measure E would increase the sales tax rate in the City of Rohnert
Park from the current nine percent (9.00%) to nine and one-half percent (9.50%) for
a period of five (5) years. A no vote on Measure E would leave the sales tax rate in
the City of Rohnert Park at its current rate of nine percent (9.00%).
