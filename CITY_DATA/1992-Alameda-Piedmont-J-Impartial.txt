Piedmont Measure J is the renewal of the municipal services tax that has been in effect for a number of years, and
has been approved by the voters in past elections. It comes up for renewal every four years, and the current tax expires
on June 30,1993.

Based on the recommendation of the Tax Review Committee, consisting of citizens appointed by the City Council,
Piedmont Measure J provides for a maximum tax rate that is 10% less than the maximum rate in the current municipal
services tax, which could potentially result in a reduction in taxes for Piedmont property owners.

In most other respects, the tax measure provides for a municipal services tax similar to that now in effect in Piedmont
(Measure W), except for a revised technical definition for “unexpended residue” that provides for a decreasing
percentage factor over the four year period of the tax, while the current tax has a fixed percentage.
