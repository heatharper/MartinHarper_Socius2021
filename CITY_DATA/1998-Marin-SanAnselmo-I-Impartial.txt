IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY TOWN ATTORNEY
MEASURE I

If this measure is approved by a two-thirds vote, the special tax for paramedic services
administered by a Joint Powers Authority authorized by the voters in 1983, 1991, and
1994, will be continued with a maximum annual levy of $30.00 on each living unit and
$30.00 per year per 1,500 square feet of structure on each developed parcel in
non-residential use, to be collected in addition to fees for transport to the hospital charged
to insurance providers, without collection pursued against uninsured persons. The
appropriations limit established for the Town of San Anselmo pursuant to Article XII1B of
the California Constitution will be increased in an amount equal to the proceeds of the
special tax. The special tax and the corresponding increase in the appropriations limit
expire on June 30, 2003.
