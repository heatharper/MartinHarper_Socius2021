IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY

MEASURE A
City of Laguna Beach
Temporary Sales and Use Tax

TEMPORARY (SIX YEAR) ONE-HALF PERCENT SALES TAX INCREASE

This ballot measure, if adopted by the voters, would enact a temporary one-half of one
percent (0.5%) increase to the sales tax rate in the City of Laguna Beach. The sales tax
increase would be effective for a period of six years, commencing on July 1, 2006 and
expiring on June 30, 2012. However, the ballot measure empowers the City Council, in
its discretion, to terminate the sales tax increase at any time prior to the expiration date.

The current sales tax rate in the City of Laguna Beach is seven and three-quarters percent
(7.75%). Thus, if this ballot measure is adopted, the sales tax rate would increase to eight
and one-quarter percent (8.25%) for a period of six years, unless earlier terminated by the
City Council. The proposed sales tax increase would be administered and applied in the
identical manner as the current sales tax.

All revenue generated from the proposed sales tax increase would be deposited into the
City's General Fund and, accordingly, all monies collected pursuant to the sales tax
increase would be appropriated and used by the City to pay for general City operations
and services.
