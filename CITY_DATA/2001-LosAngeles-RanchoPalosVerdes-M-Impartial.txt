IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE M

Ballot Measure M seeks ratification and re-adoption of the City’s existing 10%
transient occupancy tax. The transient occupancy tax is paid only by persons who
stay at hotels in the City for thirty calendar days or less and not by property
owners.

The City last adjusted the rate of the transient occupancy tax in 1991. That year,
the City Council adopted an ordinance increasing the amount of the tax from 6%
to 10% of the rent charged by the hotel operator. This Measure is being
submitted to the voters by the Rancho Palos Verdes City Council to allow the
voters to ratify and approve the increase of the tax from 6% to 10%.

Although the City has collected the transient occupancy tax from hotel guests at
the 10% rate since 1991, recent court decisions now forbid the City from
continuing to impose the tax at the 10% rate without voter approval. If adopted,
this Measure would constitute formal approval by the voters of the City Council’s
1991 increase of the transient occupancy tax and the City’s subsequent collection
of the tax at the 10% rate.

This Measure also would re-adopt Rancho Palos Verdes Municipal Code Section
3.16.030, which currently imposes the 10% transient occupancy tax. Re-adoption
of Section 3.16.030 would allow the City to continue to collect the tax at the 10%
rate in the future. Re-adoption of Section 3.16.030 also would enable the City
Council to reduce the tax, and to adjust the tax to any rate that is less than or
equal to 10%, without further voter approval.

If adopted, this Measure would not allow the City Council to increase the rate of
the transient occupancy tax in excess of 10% without voter approval.

A “yes” vote on Measure M enacts an ordinance ratifying and re-adopting the
City’s existing 10% transient occupancy tax. A “no” vote reduces the transient
occupancy tax to its pre 1991 rate of 6%.
