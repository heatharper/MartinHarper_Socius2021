MEASURE “K”

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY

AN ORDINANCE OF THE PEOPLE OF THE CITY OF
CHINO HILLS AMENDING CHAPTER 3.25, ENTITLED
“TRANSIENT OCCUPANCY TAX” OF TITLE 3,

ENTITLED “REVENUE AND FINANCE” OF THE
CHINO HILLS MUNICIPAL CODE ADOPTING A
TRANSIENT OCCUPANCY TAX AND PROVIDING
FOR THE ADMINISTRATION THEREOF

The proposed Transient Occupancy Tax Ordinance (the “proposed TOT Ordinance”), if
adopted, would enact a transient occupancy tax (the “TOT”) and provisions providing for
the administration of the tax, similar in scope and having the same rate as the existing
transient occupancy tax that is set forth in Chapter 3.25 of the Chino Hills Municipal
Code (the “existing TOT Ordinance”).

The proposed TOT Ordinance, if adopted, would revise the definitions of the terms
“Hotel” and “Tax Administrator;” and adds a definition of “motel.” It would provide for the
same rate of tax as the existing TOT Ordinance often percent (10%). The proposed
TOT Ordinance, if adopted, would expand the categories of persons exempt from the
transient occupancy tax to conform with current federal case law.

The proposed TOT Ordinance, if adopted, would revise the procedure for appealing the
tax by providing that appeals would be heard by the City Manager with a final appeal to
a City Council appointed hearing officer. The existing TOT Ordinance provides that
appeals are heard by the City Council.

The proposed TOT Ordinance, if adopted, would require specified recordkeeping,
including the maintenance by operators of registration cards, daily summary sheets,
maid reports, receipt books, bank accounts, telephone charges and other financial
records. The existing TOT Ordinance requires operators to maintain for a period of
three years all records as may be necessary to determine the amount of tax liability.

The proposed TOT Ordinance, if adopted, would reduce the period for filing for a tax
refund from three (3) years, as provided in the existing TOT Ordinance, to one (1) year.

The proposed TOT Ordinance, if adopted, would enact specific procedures for claiming
exemptions from the TOT and prescribe a fee for claims that are determined to be
invalid. The existing TOT Ordinance provides that exemptions are only granted upon a
claim made at the time rent is collected and under penalty of perjury upon a form
prescribed by the tax administrator.

The proposed TOT Ordinance, if adopted, would authorize the City Council to suspend
and thereafter reinstate the collection of the TOT and to temporarily reduce the amount of the TOT and thereafter impose the tax a rate not higher than the maximum rate
approved by the electorate. The existing TOT Ordinance contains no similar provision.
The above statement is an impartial analysis of the proposed TOT Ordinance.
