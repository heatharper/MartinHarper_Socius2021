Impartial Analysis from Berkeley’s City Attorney
The City provides various affordable youth services and youth safety programs, including, but not limited to, recreation programs, summer camps, literacy programs, after school, school break and summer programs, crossing guards, school-based police officers, violence prevention efforts, health and mental health programs, grants to community based agencies that provide services to at-risk youth, and program evaluation and coordination. The current budget identifies significant cuts to these programs. These programs have been funded primarily out of the City's General Fund. This ordinance would authorize a supplemental real property transfer special tax on specified sales of real property. The current real property transfer tax is 1.5% of sales price regardless of the price of the sale. If approved, this amendment would increase the total rate of the City's real property transfer tax on sales of $600,000 or more to 2.0% of the sales price, and on sales of $1,000,000 or more to 2.5% of the sales price, in order to pay for these and other similar programs. The tax would be subject to the same exemptions as the existing transfer tax, but not the 1/3 seismic retrofit rebate. Finally, the tax would expire on December 31, 2010. This measure would also authorize the expenditure of the additional tax proceeds resulting from the tax beginning calendar year 2005 through 2008.
Financial Implications  This special tax would be imposed upon all real property with a transfer price of $600,000 or more. It would add 0.5% to the amount of the existing transfer tax on sales of $600,000 or more, and 1% to the existing transfer tax on sales of $1,000,000 or more. The current rate is 1.5% of the sales price on all property regardless of transfer price. The additional transfer tax on sales of $600,000 or more would cost $500 for every $100,000 in sales price of property, and the additional transfer tax on sales of $1,000,000 or more would cost $1000 for every $100,000 in sales price of property.
