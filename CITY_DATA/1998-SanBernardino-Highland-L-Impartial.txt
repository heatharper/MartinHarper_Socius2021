MEASURE “L”

ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY

If approved by a majority of the qualified electors of the City, Ordinance No. 237 will add
Chapter 5.17 to the Highland Municipal Code, establishing a business license tax on the
commercial extraction and/or processing of rock, sand and gravel (aggregate) in the City.
The Ordinance further provides reporting requirements for aggregate mining and processing
operations in the City, to assist the City in verifying the annual production of aggregate
mining and production operations. These requirements include regular submission of aerial
photographs and topographical maps of mining activities.

If adopted, this business license tax will be collected from each commercial business which
mines or processes rock, sand or gravel (aggregate). “Processing" is defined in the
Ordinance to include manufacturing of cement and asphalt using rock, sand or gravel as
an ingredient, as well as rock crushing and sorting.

The proposed tax will be imposed on each ton of aggregate mined or processed in the City.
The amount of the tax is established by the Ordinance, at six cents ($.06) per ton beginning
January 1, 1999, nine cents ($.09) per ton beginning July 1, 1999, and twelve cents ($.12)
per ton beginning July 1,2000. On July 1,2001, the tax will increase to fourteen cents ($.14)
per ton, and will be adjusted annually thereafter in accordance with the Consumer Price
Index, not to exceed thirty-five cents ($.35) per ton.

The tax will generate revenue for the City which may be used for general municipal purposes.
As mining and processing of rock, sand and gravel (aggregate) in the City increase, the
amount of tax revenue received by the City will also increase.
