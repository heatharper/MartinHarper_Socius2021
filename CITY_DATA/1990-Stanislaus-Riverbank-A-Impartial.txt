ANALYSIS OF CITY MEASURE ON BALLOT

The following analysis of the ballot measure for the
special municipal election on June 5, 1990, has been prepared by
the City Attorney's office.

Measure A:	Shall an ordinance adding Chapter 18 to the

Code of the City of Riverbank, "authorizing the imposition of an
excise tax on new construction, at. the rate of two (2%) percent
of the value of new construction as determined by the City
Building Department", be adopted? If Measure A passes, new
construction within the City of Riverbank will be taxed at the
rate of two (2%) percent of the value of that construction, as
determined by the City Building Department. The tax imposed
shall be collected at the time a building permit is issued.

No tax shall be imposed for remodeling of existing building
or structures, unless such construction is for a change of use or
adds additional floor area. All of the revenue generated by the
tax imposed by the additional chapter is intended for general
governmental purposes and shall be placed in the general fund of
the City.

The proposed measure provides appellant procedures and
imposes penalties for nonpayment.
