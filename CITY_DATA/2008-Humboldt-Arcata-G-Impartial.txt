MEASURE G
IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY

A Measure to Approve a Transactions and Use Sales Tax
In the City of Arcata

If approved by a majority of the voters, Measure G would authorize
an additional three-quarter percent (3/4%) transactions and use sales
tax to be levied within the City of Arcata. This tax would be a general
purpose tax, and all revenue raised from the tax would go into the
City’s general fund to be used for any municipal governmental
purpose. Municipal governmental purposes include public works and
police protection services identified in the ballot measure, and may
include other governmental functions and services. The Measure
would not bind the City to use the tax revenue for any particular
services, facilities, or programs.

The 3/4% sales tax would be levied in addition to the current sales
tax and would be collected at the same time and in the same manner
as the existing sales tax. Currently the sales tax in Arcata (including
State and local taxes) is 7 1/4%. If this Measure is approved, the sales
tax in the City of Arcata would be 8%. The increased tax is estimated
to generate approximately $1,500,000 per year.

Measure G contains fiscal accountability provisions, which include
the creation by the City Council of a citizens’ oversight committee
to annually review the City’s expenditure of revenues generated by
the tax. The composition of the oversight committee and its specific
duties would be established by the City Council.

If approved by a majority of the voters at the November 4, 2008
election, the 3/4% sales tax would become operative on April 1,2009
and would terminate 20 years after its approval.
