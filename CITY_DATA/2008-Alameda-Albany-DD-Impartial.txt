CITY ATTORNEY IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF
MEASURE DD

PROPOSED MODIFICATION TO THE REAL
PROPERTY TRANSFER TAX ORDINANCE, SEC-
TION 4-5.2 OF THE ALBANY MUNICIPAL CODE

A “Yes” vote approves a modification of Albany’s real
property transfer tax from $11.50 per thousand to $14.50
per thousand.

A “No” vote rejects amending the Real Property Transfer Tax ordinance that presently provides for a tax of
$11.50 per thousand.

This is a general tax and it requires a majority vote of
those voting at this election.

Background

Albany is a charter city. Charter cities can enact real
property transfer tax ordinances. These ordinances require
a transfer tax to be paid when a property is sold. Albany
has had such an ordinance for many years. Over time, the
tax rate has been changed. The last change was in 2002.
The Proposed Change

If adopted, at the time of sale a $14.50 per thousand
dollars of consideration would be levied. The buyer or
seller, or as agreed by the buyer and seller, would have to
pay the tax.

If, for example, a property sold for $500,000.00, the
tax would be $7,250.00. Presently, the tax is $11.50 per
thousand, or $5,750.00 for a $500,000.00 house.
