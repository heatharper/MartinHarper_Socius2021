IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE “Y”

(Public Safety Tax)

Passage of this measure would result in the levying of a public safety tax in the amount of $94.19 per equivalent dwelling unit to fund the hiring of
seven additional fire fighters, the implementation of a paramedic engine company program, the hiring of seven additional police officers and the
hiring of four civilian police personnel. This is a special tax which may be utilized only for the purpose indicated in the ballot measure.

An equivalent dwelling unit and hence, the specific amount of the tax is determined pursuant to the following formula:

Property Type Land Use Code		EDU	Multiplier
Commercial Vacant	CMV	0.500	Per Parcel
Commercial Developed	COM	4.000	Per Acre
Multi Family Residential	MFR	1.000	Per Unit
Multi Family Vacant	MFV	0.500	Per Parcel
Mobile Home Park	MHP	1.000	Per Unit
Recreational	REC	2000	Per Acre
Single Family Residential	SFR	1.000	Per Unit
Single Family Vacant	SFV	0.500	Per Parcel
Under-Developed Commercial	UDC	2.000	Per Acre
Under-Developed Residential	UDR	1.000	Per Unit
Undefined Vacant	UDV	0.000	Per Parcel

The $94.19 is the maximum which may be levied by three affirmative votes of the City Council.

If the property owner subject to the special tax believes that the payment of the tax during a fiscal year would create a hardship, the property-owner may appeal the levy by filing a hardship appeal to the City Council.

It is anticipated that the tax will generate $502,000 dollars for fire services and $958,000 dollars for police services. This tax will only be effective if
approved by two-thirds (2/3rd’s) majority of the voters voting in the election and may only be amended or repealed by the same process.
