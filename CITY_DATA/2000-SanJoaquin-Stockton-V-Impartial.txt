IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE V

Existing law requires that each operator of a hotel, motel, inn, rooming

house, mobile home or similar structure located in the City of Stockton
collect a tax (known as the Transient Occupancy Tax) from persons who
use the same for dwelling, lodging, or sleeping purposes for 30 days or
less. This tax is currently eight percent (8%) of the rent charged by the
operator and is imposed on the person who occupies the premises. It is
collected by the operator at the time rent is due.

Each month the operator is required to report the rents charged for
that month and the amount of tax collected and remit the tax to the
City of Stockton.

This measure would require that the amount of transient occupancy tax collected by the operator be increased by one percent (1 %)
from the current eight percent (8%) to nine percent (9%).

The average annual revenue derived from the Transient Occupancy Tax, over the last ten years, has been $1.21 million. It is anticipated that, if passed, a one percent (1%) increase in the Transient
Occupancy Tax will generate approximately $121,000 per annum in
additional City revenue.
