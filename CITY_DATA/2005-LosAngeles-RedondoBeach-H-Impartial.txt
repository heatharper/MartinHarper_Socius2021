IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF PROPOSITION H

A BALLOT MEASURE TO ADJUST THE BUSINESS

LICENSE TAX BY THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX

The City of Redondo Beach’s ordinance currently
authorizes the City to impose an annual license tax on
businesses which provide goods and services in the City
of Redondo Beach, in varying rates depending on the
classification of the business. The business license tax
rates were last adjusted in 1991.

Proposition H, if adopted, would amend the City’s
ordinance to authorize the City to establish an annual
Consumer Price Index (CPI) adjustment to the rates of
the business license tax, beginning in July 2005.
