City Attorney’s Impartial Analysis
Measure M
Half-Cent Sales Tax Proposal

The measure would adopt a half-cent transactions and use tax in the City of
Grass Valley. This kind of tax is often called a "sales" tax. The money from this
tax would go in the City's general fund and could be used for any City purpose,
including but not limited to: new police officers and firefighters, police and fire
equipment, street paving and other City services as determined by the City
Council.

The tax would be in addition to existing sales taxes. It would be collected at the
same time and in much the same way as existing sales taxes. It would only apply
to purchases of things subject to existing sales taxes. For example, purchases of
prescription drugs and most food would not be taxed.

The City Council unanimously approved the proposed tax and a simple majority
of voters must also approve it before it can take effect.

The tax will end in ten years or, if the City's general sales tax revenues return to
2007 levels before then, the City Council will be required to hold a public hearing
to consider ending it sooner. The Council will be required to appoint a Citizens
Oversight Committee to:

•	review an annual, independent audit of tax receipts and how they are
spent;

•	advise the City Council on how proceeds should be spent; and

•	review whether the City's general sales taxes have returned to 2007 levels
so the City Council should end the tax early.

Tax proceeds and spending must be audited yearly by an independent auditor
and the Council must discuss the results of those audits at public meetings and
post them on the City's website.
