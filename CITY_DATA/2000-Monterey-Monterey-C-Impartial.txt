CITY OF MONTEREY MEASURE C

Since 1988, the City has collected a fee via special assessment to
help fund the provision of emergency medical services within Monterey.
The amount of the fee authorized by the voters to be collected was
the sum of $5 per benefit unit per year, however, only $4 per unit
has been collected.

In 1996, Proposition 218 passed, requiring that assessments such
as this be replaced by special taxes for the same purpose.

The City proposes to change the assessment previously approved
by the voters to a special tax. The maximum tax to be collected is
the same as the maximum assessment previously authorized. While
the impact to residents of the City is the same, because new taxes
require approval by 2/3 of the electorate, the matter must be
resubmitted to the people for a vote. The fee is separate from any
fee charged by the County of Monterey and can only be used to
provide emergency medical services within the City of Monterey.

The Monterey City Council approved this tax at their meeting of
November 2, 1999; however, it will not take effect until and unless
approved by 2/3 of the voters voting on the measure at the March 7,
2000 election. If approved, the tax cannot be increased without a
subsequent vote of the people.
