MEASURE H
(Impartial Analysis By City Attorney)

Section 1224 of the Charter of the City of Fresno provides that the City will not tax any person for his or
her use of utility services. Such utility services include, but are not limited to, intrastate telephone
communication service, gas delivered through mains or pipes, cable television service and electrical
energy.

This measure would amend Section 1224 and would allow the City of Fresno to impose a utility users tax
not to exceed five percent. This measure requires a minimum fifty dollar lifeline to be credited against gas
and electrical service bills. The amount of this lifeline is to be adjusted annually according to the National
Consumer Price Index.

Passage of this amendment does not automatically impose a utility users tax. The proposed change would
authorize the City Council to enact this tax within the limits set forth in the amended Charter language.
Enactment of a utility users tax would require separate legislative action by the City Council.
