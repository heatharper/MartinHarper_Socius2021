IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE S

Measure S seeks approval for the establishment of utility
user tax (“UUT"). The UUT is a tax that South Gate
businesses and residents would pay on the use of
electric, telephone, water, and natural gas services.
Measure S limits the amount of the UUT to five percent
(5%) and provides a sunset provision that automatically
eliminates the UUT on July 1, 2010. The City Council
can reduce the rate of the UUT from time to time, but
can never increase the rate above the 5% cap without
the prior approval of the voters.

The revenues from the UUT are not designated for any
specific purpose and may be used to fund general City
services and programs, such as police, parks and
recreation, street maintenance and library services.

The City’s general fund operating budget is facing an
anticipated revenue shortfall of $6 million that may result
in the curtailment of essential City services such as
police, parks and recreation, and other City facilities and
services. Revenue from Measure S will be used toward
reducing the shortfall, but will be insufficient to
completely satisfy the anticipated deficit.

A 5% with a $50,000 annual cap, this UUT would be the
lowest among Cities that have enacted such a tax. The
UUT is expected to produce $2.6 million annually for the
City and would account for approximately 9.5% of the
City’s general fund revenues.

A “Yes” vote on Measure S will establish a UUT. A “No”
vote will deny the establishment of a UUT.
