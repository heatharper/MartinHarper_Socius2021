CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE M

Measure M seeks voter approval of a Utility Users Tax Ordinance. If passed, the
Ordinance would impose a four percent (4%) utility user tax based on charges to
residential and commercial customers for electric and gas utilities. The tax would
automatically expire after six years, and could only be extended with an additional
vote of the people.

The Ordinance generally provides for the tax to be collected by utility companies
and paid as part of regular utility bills. It is expected to raise approximately
$375,000. The average cost to a residential utility user would be $4.48 per month,
and the average cost to a business utility user would be $25.84 per month. These
averages are based on bills from all PG&E customers, and individual bills will vary
based on actual consumption of gas and electricity. The Ordinance provides an exemption to low-income utility users who are participating in the PG&E California
Alternate Rates for Energy (“CARE") program.

The Utility Users Tax would be a general tax, and as such must be approved by a
simple majority of the voters voting in the election. The proceeds of the tax, as a
general tax, will be deposited in the City’s general fund and used for general governmental purposes, such as police and fire protection services, and street and
park maintenance.

A “yes” vote is a vote to adopt a Utility Users Tax on the use of electricity and gas in the City of Sebastopol, at a rate not to exceed 4%, for a period of 6 years, for general fund purposes. A “no" vote is a vote not to adopt a Utility Users Tax.

The above statement is an impartial analysis of Measure M. The definition of each
utility service and a description of how the tax is calculated and collected are more
particularly described in the Ordinance.
