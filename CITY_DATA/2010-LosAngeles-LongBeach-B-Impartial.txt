City Attorney

Voter approval of Measure B would amend the Long Beach Municipal Code to
establish a new business license tax on recreational marijuana businesses
operating in the City of Long Beach if the recreational use of marijuana is
legalized. This business license tax is a “general tax” and therefore must be
approved by the voters. Revenues from the tax would be deposited in the City’s
general fund which is used to pay for police and fire protection, senior and youth
programs, street repairs, parks and recreation, code enforcement, libraries, and
other City services.

For many years, Long Beach has imposed a business license tax on businesses.
This measure, if approved, would establish a new category of “marijuana
business” and would impose a tax of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) per
thousand dollars of gross receipts for recreational marijuana sales, and a tax of
twenty-five dollars ($25.00) per square foot on all improvements used by the
marijuana business as a cultivation facility or grow site. Marijuana businesses
that qualify under state law as exempt non-profit organizations would pay ten
dollars ($10.00) per square foot on all business improvements, instead of paying
a tax based on the gross receipts of the business.

The tax imposed would be adjusted annually for inflation as measured by the Los
Angeles-Riverside-Orange County Area Consumer Price Index. This measure
would not impose a tax on any facility operating with a valid medical marijuana
collective permit. A “yes” vote on this proposition is a vote to approve the
recreational marijuana business license tax if marijuana is legalized. A “no” vote
is a vote to reject this tax.
