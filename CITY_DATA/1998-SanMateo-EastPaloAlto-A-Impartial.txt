IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE A

This proposed measure, if adopted, would establish a tax of twelve
percent (12%) to be added to the rate that a guest would pay for staying in a
hotel, or similar establishment, in East Palo Alto. This type of tax is often
called a transient occupancy tax because of its impact on travelers. The tax
would fall on the hotel guest, with the hotel operator being responsible for
collecting the tax and reporting it to the city of East Palo Alto. For example,
a guest paying $100 a day for the privilege of staying in a hotel would pay an
additional $12 a day for this tax. The $12 would be paid to the City.

This proposed measure generally defines a hotel as any structure occupied by transients for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes, and includes
any hotel, inn, tourist home or house, motel, studio hotel, or other similar
structure. Excluded from this definition are facilities licensed by the state of
California or county of San Mateo as group care or foster care facilities
primarily intended for the protection and/or safe care of the occupants and
residents thereof.

Currently there are no hotels or similar establishments in East Palo
Alto that fall within this proposed measure's definition. Therefore, this
measure, if adopted, would apply to a hotel or similar facility constructed in
the future.

Any revenue generated by this measure would be deposited into the
City's General Fund and could be used for any legitimate governmental
purpose.

Many cities in California have hotel or transient occupancy taxes that
operate in the same way as this proposed measure. Each city decides its own
rate and the use of funds generated by its tax.

This being a new tax, it must be approved by a majority of voters voting on the measure at the November 3, 1998 General Municipal Election.
