IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE H

This measure, if adopted by a simple majority of voters voting on the
measure, would accomplish the following:

•	validates and allows continued collection of the five percent (5%)
utility users tax until November 30, 2002.

•	imposes said utility users tax on cellular telephones and similar
communications technology.

The utility users tax, as set forth in Ordinance No. 103, was adopted by
the East Palo Alto City Council in February, 1989. Ordinance No. 103
imposes a 5% surcharge on electricity, gas, telephone and water services.
Ordinance No. 169, adopted by the City Council in April 1994, extended
the 5% surcharge to cable television services.

The utility users tax, which generates approximately $1 million per
year, goes into the City’s General Fund and is used for general government
purposes, including police and public safety, parks and recreation, street
improvements, youth and senior citizen services and the like.

This measure would validate the City Council-approved tax and allow
its continued collection for the purposes listed above until November 30,2006,
when the tax expires, or ‘sunsets.’ Further voter approval would be
required to extend the tax past the ‘sunset’ date.

This measure would also extend the tax to cellular telephones and
similar communications technology not currently covered by Ordinance
Nos. 103 and 169.
