IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE O

This ballot measure extends for five years the City of San Marino Public Safety
Tax for paramedic, police and fire protection services. The Public Safety Tax is a
tax on each parcel of real property in the City and is authorized under the
authority of Section 4 of Article X1II-A of the California Constitution. As a
special tax, the proceeds can only be used for paramedic, police and fire
protection services. The City may not use the funds for any other purpose.

Approval of the measure will extend the Public Safety Tax for a period of five
years. The tax would expire at that time unless extended by the voters.

The ordinance contains maximum rates for each year that can be exceeded only
if the increase is approved by the voters. The measure contains credits for parcels
purchased subsequent to March 1, 1975, to partially compensate the higher
property tax persons purchasing property subsequent to that date are paying
pursuant to the reassessment revisions of “Proposition 13.” The measure also
contains a credit for parcels owned by senior citizens whose income does not
exceed levels the City Council can establish from time to time.

As a special tax, the measure requires a two-thirds vote of the persons voting at
the election. A yes vote on Measure O extends the existing Public Safety Special
Tax and assessment amounts for four years. A no vote would eliminate the
Public Safety Special Tax at the end of the current fiscal year.
