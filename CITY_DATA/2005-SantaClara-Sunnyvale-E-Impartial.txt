Impartial Analysis from City Attorney
California law permits a city to increase a general tax within its jurisdiction if the tax increase is approved by a simple majority of the voters voting in an election.
The transient occupancy tax applies to persons renting hotel rooms in the City of Sunnyvale. The City of Sunnyvale proposes to increase its existing transient occupancy tax of 8.5 percent of rent charged, the lowest in the region, to 9.5 percent, phased in over 2 years. The transient occupancy tax would increase to 9 percent on January 1, 2007. The tax would increase to its maximum of 9.5 percent on January 1, 2009, provided that the average citywide hotel/motel occupancy rate from January 1 through September 30, 2008, is at least 60 percent. In any event, the tax after January 1, 2010, would be set at 9.5 percent of the rent charged. The tax applies only to persons staying in hotels or motels in the city of Sunnyvale for 30 consecutive calendar days or less.
The proceeds of the transient occupancy tax , as a general tax, will be deposited in the city's general fund and used for general governmental purposes, including police and fire protection services, library, and parks services.
A "yes" vote is a vote to increase the City of Sunnyvale transient occupancy tax from its current rate of 8.5 percent to 9.5 percent with the tax phased in over a two-year period starting January 1, 2007.
A "no" vote is a vote not to increase the transient occupancy tax from its current rate of 8.5 percent.
