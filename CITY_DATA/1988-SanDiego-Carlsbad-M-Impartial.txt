Proposition M asks the people of Carlsbad to adopt an ordinance adding Section
3.12.035 to the Carlsbad Municipal Code to increase the existing 8% transient
occupancy tax rate by an additional 2% of the charge for the room. All other provisions
of the transient occupancy tax would remain the same. This ordinance has been
unanimously adopted by the City Council. Proposition 62, passed at the November 4,
1986 election, also requires adoption by a two-thirds vote of the voters voting in this
election. The two-thirds requirement applies because the proceeds of the 2% increase
must be used for the purposes specified in the ordinance which are: As the first
priority, an amount as determined by the City Council, must be used for the
construction of a quality regulation 18 hole municipal public golf course and for the
construction of a complex of public tennis courts and related facilities in the City of
Carlsbad. A second priority requires that an amount, as determined necessary by the
City Council, be used for the construction of an additional short golf course or
additional tennis courts or ball fields or other recreational facilities. Tax proceeds may
be used to support bond financing for the facilities specified In the ordinance. Any
proceeds remaining would go to the general fund. If this measure is approved the
ordinance would be effective after the results of the vote are declared by the City
Council. However, the levy of the increased tax will be phased with one percent to be
collected beginning on July 1,1989 and an additional one percent beginning on January
1,1990.
