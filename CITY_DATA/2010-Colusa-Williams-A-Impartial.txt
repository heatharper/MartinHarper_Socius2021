CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF
MEASURE A

The City of Williams currently imposes a transient
occupancy tax (TOT), also known as a hotel room tax, at
the rate of 10 percent of the rent paid to occupy a room
or other space in a hotel. This tax is generally paid by
visitors to the City who stay at hotels located within the
City. The TOT is imposed upon paying guests of hotels
and other transient accommodations for the privilege of
occupying a room or other hotel space for a period of
thirty consecutive calendar days or less.

The passage of Measure A would amend the Williams
Municipal Code to increase the TOT rate by two percent
and establish a rate of 12 percent. The new TOT rate
would be collected by operators of hotels at the time rent
is paid for occupying a hotel room or other space.

Measure A is a general tax and may be used for any
general governmental purpose of the City, such as police
services, street maintenance and park maintenance.
In order for the City to adopt the amendments to its
Municipal Code establishing the new TOT rate, Measure
A must be approved by a majority of the votes cast on
the ballot proposition.

A YES vote on Measure A will approve the amendment to
the Williams Municipal Code establishing the City’s TOT
rate at 12 percent.

A NO vote on Measure A will prohibit the City from
adopting the amendment to the Williams Municipal Code
establishing the City’s TOT rate at 12 percent.
