

CITY ATTORNEY'S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE F

Under the City's current business license tax, retailers who sell guns and ammunition are taxed on their gross receipts at the same rate as other retailers: $1.20
per $1000.00. This ordinance would increase their gross receipts tax to $150.00
per $1000.00. There appear to be no dealers who appear to be currently subject
to the tax. The City Council may repeal this ordinance, or amend it in a manner
which does not result in an increase in the tax imposed herein, without further
voter approval. If the City Council repeals this ordinance, it may subsequently
reenact it without voter approval, as long as the reenacted ordinance does not
result in an increase in the tax imposed herein.
