TOWN ATTORNEY'S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE N

On June 22, 2004, the Town Council of Paradise approved Ordinance No. 423
adding Chapter 3.26 to the Paradise Municipal Code, which would impose a $1.00
per month tax on every parcel within the Town of Paradise for the sole purpose of
funding the operation and maintenance of the Townâ€™s animal control services and
shelter.

According to the Town Finance Director, if this measure is approved by the voters,
it would result in approximately $144,000 of additional revenue to the Town per
year. All revenues generated by the tax increase would be deposited in a special
fund and would be allocated for animal control purposes.

Under the California Constitution, a yes vote on this special tax measure by
two-thirds of the voting electors is necessary for the ordinance to become effective.
