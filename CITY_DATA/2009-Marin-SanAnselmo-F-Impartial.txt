TOWN ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS
OF MEASURE F

If this measure is approved by the voters, beginning on
July 1, 2010, a uniform hotel users tax of ten percent
(10%) will be imposed on hotel rooms in San Anselmo to
be paid by hotel users, with the revenue generated by the
tax to be deposited into the Town general fund and to be
used for the Town’s general purposes.

The measure would establish a new ordinance at Chapter
7, Title 8 of the San Anselmo Municipal Code. The ordinance would define “hotel” as any structure, or any portion
of any structure, which is occupied or intended or
designed for occupancy by hotel users for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes and would include any hotel, inn,
bed and breakfast inn, tourist home or house, motel,
mobile home or other lodging.

The ordinance would further define “hotel user” as any
person who exercises occupancy in a “hotel,” or is entitled
to such occupancy, by reason of concession, permit, right
of access, license or other agreement for a period of 30
consecutive calendar days or less, counting portions of
calendar days as full days. The ordinance would require
that hotel users pay the 10 percent (10%) tax to the hotel
operators, based on the rent charged for the hotel rooms.
The operator would be required to collect the tax and to
state the tax separately from the amount of rent charged.
Hotel operators would be required to file regular reports
with the Town concerning the total rents charged and the
total tax collected. The ordinance would include penalty
provisions to be applied against any hotel operator who
fails to collect, report, and remit the hotel users tax. Such
hotel operator would be entitled to request a hearing
before the Town Manager to contest the Town’s proposed
imposition of any tax or penalty.

A YES vote approves the measure.

A NO vote rejects the measure.
