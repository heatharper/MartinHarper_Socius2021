IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
CITY OF RIDGECREST
MEASUREN

The ordinance provides for a three-quarters percent additional sales tax for ten
years to fund specific projects that are listed in an expenditure plan provided by
the City on February 20,2008. The expenditures are expressly limited to street improvement projects and are prioritized based upon need. The tax would also pay
for a citizenâ€™s advisory committee with oversight to ensure the proceeds are spent
on the projects listed in the expenditure plan. The tax requires a two-thirds (2/3)
affirmative vote to pass.
