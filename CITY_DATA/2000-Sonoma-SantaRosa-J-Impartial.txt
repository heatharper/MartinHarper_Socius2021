CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE J

The City of Santa Rosa’s transient occupancy tax is assessed to, and paid
by persons who occupy a hotel room or rooms in the City for sleeping or
lodging purposes for 30 consecutive calendar days or less. “Hotel” includes
a hotel, inn, motel, bed and breakfast establishment, tourist home and
similar places. The tax is calculated on the charge for the occupancy of the
hotel room. The tax is collected by the hotel operator and remitted to the
City. Measure J, if approved by the voters, will increase the rate of the
transient occupancy tax by 3 percent. The City’s current transient occupancy tax is 9 percent. Measure J would increase.the tax rate to 12 percent.

The City’s transient occupancy tax is a general tax which means that the
revenues it generates are to be used for general governmental purposes
and cannot be restricted or pledged to a specific purpose.

The transient occupancy tax rate increase under Measure J applies only to
hotels situated in the City of Santa Rosa. There is another measure on the
same ballot with Measure J, which will be voted upon by all Sonoma County
voters, including Santa Rosa City voters, and which would, if approved,
increase the transient occupancy tax in the unincorporated areas of
Sonoma County by 3 percent. The two measures are separate and a vote
on one measure will not be counted as a vote on the other.

The transient occupancy tax increase under Measure J would be accomplished by the amendment of Section 3-28.020 of the Santa Rosa City
Code. A copy of the ordinance amending Section 3-28.020 is included
in the Voters Information pamphlet. The ordinance would be adopted and
the tax increased if the majority of those voting on Measure J vote “yes."
The tax increase would become effective on January 1,2001.
