Summary Prepared by City of Oakland Attorney
The measure creates a new Business Tax rate for "Cannabis Businesses" of $18 for each $1,000 of gross receipts from business activity. Currently, Cannabis Businesses in Oakland are taxed at the rate for retail sales businesses, which is $60.00 per year for the first $50,000.00 of gross receipts, plus $1.20 for each additional $1,000.00. The City of Oakland may use the revenue from the tax for any legal municipal purpose, including but not limited to maintenance of vital services and facilities. The tax must be approved by a majority of Oakland voters who cast ballots.
