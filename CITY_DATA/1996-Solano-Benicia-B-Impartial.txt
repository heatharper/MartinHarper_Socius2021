IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
CITY OF BENICIA
MEASURE B

The purpose of Measure B is lo obtain voter approval of the continued collection of the
City's 9 percent Transient Occupancy Tax.

In 1986, California voters enacted Proposition 62. The measure added states
that, among other things, required local governments to obtain a majority vote approval
of the Imposition of any general tax. Many legal experts opinions of this voter approval
requirement violated a provision of the California Constitution' In 1991, the California
Court of Appeal published a decision in the case entitled City of Woodlake v. Logan In
which It concluded that the voter approval requirement cf Proposition 62 was unconstitutional.

The City has for decades imposed a tax on the occupancy of hotel and motel rooms.
In 1993, the Benicia City Council adopted Ordinance No. 93-13 which increased the rate
of the tax from 6 percent to 9 percent. This ordinance was not submitted to the voters
for approval.

In September 1995, the California Supreme Court overruled the Wood lake decision, and
concluded that the Proposition 62 voter approval requirement did not violate the California
Constitution. This opinion has raised a question about the legal ability of the City to
continue lo impose me 3 percent increase in the Transient Occupancy Tax.

The proposed measure, if passed, would authorize Hie continued imposition of the 9
percent Transient Occupancy Tax pursuant to the ordinance adopted In 1993. No other
provision of Benicia Municipal Code Chapter 3.24 relating to the imposition and collection
of the Transient would be affected by the passage of this measure. The
tax ordinance establishing Transient Occupancy Tax does not provide a date for its
expiration.
