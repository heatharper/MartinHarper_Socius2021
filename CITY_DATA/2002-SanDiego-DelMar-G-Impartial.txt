CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS

Del Mar’s 10 percent transient occupancy tax (TOT) is imposed on hotel/motel visitors and is
collected by the hotel operator. In 1988, the City’s voters approved a tax of eight percent. In 1991,
the City Council increased the tax from 8 percent to 10 percent. By the adoption of Proposition 218
in 1996, State law now requires that the tax rate increased by the City Council be approved by the
voters, or no longer be imposed.

Most of the cities in San Diego County have TOT rates of 10 percent or more.
The City of San Diego’s rate is 10 1/2 percent.

If this proposition is approved, the taxes of City residents will not increase.

A "yes” vote would validate the TOT increase imposed in 1991, and would increase the TOT by
one-half of one percent. The resulting 10 1/2 percent rate of this proposition would be the same as
that imposed by the City of San Diego.

A “no” vote would reduce the current 10 percent TOT rate to 8 percent.

This proposition requires approval by a majority of those voting.
