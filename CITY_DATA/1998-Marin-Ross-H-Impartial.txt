IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY TOWN ATTORNEY
MEASURE H

If this measure is approved by a two-thirds vote, the special tax for paramedic services
administered by a Joint Powers Authority authorized by the voters in 1983, 1991, and
1994, will be continued with a maximum annual levy of $30.00 on each living unit and
$30.00 per year per 1,500 square feet of structure on each developed parcel in
non-residential use. The appropriations limit established for the Town of Ross pursuant
to Article XIIIB of the California Constitution will be increased in an amount equal to the
proceeds of the special tax. The special tax and the corresponding increase in the
appropriations limit expire on June 30, 2003.
