IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS MEASURE M

Pursuant to the provisions of Elections Code Section 5011, the
following is submitted as impartial analysis of City Measure M to appear
on the ballot at the election to be held November 8, 1988.

MEASURE M

Shall the taxes imposed on users of telephone services,
electricity and gas by Sections 3.32.030, 3.32.040, and
3.32.050 respectively of the Palm Springs Municipal Code
continue to be imposed until November 15,1993, and then
cease unless continuation past that date is approved by
majority vote at an election held before November 15,

1992, and shall the appropriations limit imposed by Article
XIIIB of the California Constitution be increased in amounts
equivalent to the proceeds of such taxes?

Existing ordinances of the City of Palm Springs impose a 3% tax on
the charges made to users of telephone services, electricity and gas. Under
existing State law, such tax may not continue to be imposed on or after
November 15,1988, unless approved by a majority of the voters voting
in an election on the issue of imposition.

If a majority of the voters vote in favor of this measure, the 3% tax
on telephone services, electricity and gas may continue until November
15, 1993. The tax shall cease on or before that date unless further
continuation of the tax is approved by the voters at another election held
before November 15, 1992.

If a majority of the voters vote in favor of this measure, the
appropriations limit of the City of Palm Springs pursuant to California
Constitution Article XIII B will increase by an amount equal to the
aggregate sum collected by levy of the utility users taxes.

If a majority of the voters vote against this measure, the 3% tax on
telephone service, electricity and gas will no longer be imposed on and
after November 15, 1988. The fiscal effect of cessation of the tax
would be a reduction of revenue to the City of Palm Springs estimated at
$2,300,000 each year.
