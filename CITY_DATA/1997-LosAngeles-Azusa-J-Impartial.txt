IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE J

Under Article of the California Constitution, 

City of Azusa, are authorized to impose new or increase existing general taxes,
if a proposed new levy or increase is approved by a majority of the voters.

The passage of Measure J by a majority of voters in the City would enact
Ordinance No. 97-014. This ordinance authorizes the City to increase the existing
commercial property rental tax to $8.00 on each $1,000 of rental income receipts.

The revenue from the increase will generate approximately $40,000. This measure
increases an existing tax and does not establish a new tax. The proceeds from these
taxes will go into the City’s Genera! Fund to replace revenues lost due to the
impacts of Proposition 218. The general tax revenue can be used to finance all
types of general municipal services, including, but not limited to, parks and
recreation, library, senior citizen program, building, planning, public works and
emergency and safety services.

If approved, the measure will add the necessary authorizing provisions to the
Azusa Municipal Code. In the future, the tax rates can only be changed or
increased by a majority vote of the voters. However, the measure will authorize
the City Council to implement any necessary procedures for collection of the
taxes.

A “yes” vote will authorize an increase in the commercial rental receipts tax. A
“no” vote is a vote against an increase in this tax.
