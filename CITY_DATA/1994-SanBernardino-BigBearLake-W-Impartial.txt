MEASURE “W”

ANALYSIS BY DISTRICT COUNSEL

Article Xiil A of the California Constitution {the “Jarvis Amendment") limits the maximum
tax on real property to a total of 1% of the full value of the property, unless an additional
special tax is authorized by a twoThirds (2/3rds) vote of the qualified electors from within the
area subject to the special tax. Measure “W", if approved, will authorize the Bear Valley
Community Hospital District to levy an annual special tax upon all taxable parcels of real
property within the District. The amount of the special tax for each year will be determined
annually by resolution of the Board of Directors, but it shall not exceed on an annual basis
twenty dollars ($20) per parcel of unimproved taxable real property within the District and
forty- five ($45) per parcel of improved taxable real property within the District. The tax will
be imposed only for five (5) years. To become effective, the measure requires the affirmative
vote of at least two-thirds (2/3rds) of the voters voting on the measure.
