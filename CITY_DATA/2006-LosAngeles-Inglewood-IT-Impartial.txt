IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE IT

The purpose of this proposed measure is to increase the sales and use tax in the
City of Inglewood by 0.5%. Pursuant to the terms of the proposed ordinance, the
funds would be used to enhance the City of Inglewoodâ€™s ability to provide vital
services to its residents, such as public safety, youth programs, crime reduction
programs and others. Its purpose is also to ensure that the City has the financial
means to provide for the well-being and security of its residents and businesses as
the City and the economic base grows. The City would be required to separately
account for and audit these funds annually.

Approval of this measure would increase the sales and use tax from 8.25% to
8.75%. This tax would affect all sales transactions that occur within the City, as
well as use transactions for City of Inglewood residents regardless of where the
use transaction (e.g., automobile purchase) occurs.
