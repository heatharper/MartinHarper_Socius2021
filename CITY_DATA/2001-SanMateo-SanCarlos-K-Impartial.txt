IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE K

In 1992 the City of San Carlos enacted by ordinance Chapter 5.04 of
the Municipal Code establishing a comprehensive Business Registration
Tax System (the Ordinance). The Ordinance superceded and simplified
the previous business license tax system that had been in effect for 30
years, by establishing different categories of businesses taxed at different
rates based on the type of business involved.

The Ordinance established an annual date for the tax, and allowed for
an automatic 4% increase per year.

At the time the City Council adopted the Ordinance in 1992,
California court decisions allowed the tax to be imposed without a vote of
the electorate. Subsequently, those decisions have been reversed and it is
now a requirement for every tax to be approved by the voters. As a result,
the City Council has now placed the Business Registration Tax on the
ballot for voter approval in the form of Measure K (the Measure).

The Business Registration Tax proposed by this Measure is a general
tax and as a result requires a majority vote, meaning more than 50 % of the
voters voting for approval. If enacted, this Measure can only be modified
by a subsequent measure submitted to and approved by the voters.

In summary, this Measure would enable the present Business Registration Tax Ordinance, that has been operable for the past nine years, to
remain in effect.
