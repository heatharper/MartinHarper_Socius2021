MEASURE D

This ballot measure proposes the adoption of an ordinance
establishing a special tax in the Town of Ross that may be
used only for public safety services. The proposed tax
replaces the Town’s former Municipal Services Tax that
has expired. The special tax will remain in effect for four
years, expiring on June 30, 2017. As a special tax, two-thirds of the voters voting on the tax must vote in its favor
for the tax to be adopted.

The maximum tax rate for the public safety tax is $950 per
improved parcel. The tax applies to parcels used for single
family, multi-family, commercial and other non-residential purposes. The term “parcel” is defined by the ordinance to mean a parcel of real property having a separate
assessor’s parcel number as shown on the last equalized
assessment roll of Marin County. The ordinance requires
that each year the Town Council must conduct a public
hearing to determine the amount of the public safety tax
based on the desired level of public safety services. However, the amount of the tax established each year by the
Town Council cannot exceed the maximum rate approved
by the voters.

The ordinance amends Chapter 3.20 of the Ross Municipal
Code in its entirety by replacing the Municipal Services
Tax with a Public Safety Tax. The ordinance provides that
the tax will not be applicable to any parcel exempted by
law, specifies the method of collection by the County of
Marin on behalf of the Town of Ross, and requires that the
maximum rate of the tax can be increased only with the
approval of two thirds of the voters voting on the increase.
The ordinance also increases the Town’s appropriation
limit established by Article XIIIB, Section 6 of the California Constitution which will allow the Town to spend the
proceeds of this special tax.
