CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS

The area in the northern portion of Santee commonly known as Fanita Ranch has been the subject
of development applications dating back to the City’s incorporation. In May 1999, the Santee City
Council approved the most recent of these applications, the Fanita Ranch Specific Plan, submitted
by Westbrook-Fanita Ranch Limited in 1997 with other related applications. In July 1999, the City
Council was presented with notification that petitions had been submitted with sufficient signatures
to require submission of the Fanita Ranch approvals to the voters. This submission is the subject
of Measures A and B.

If the voters do not approve Measure A, or do not approve Measure B, the Fanita Ranch project
will not be developed pursuant to the Council-approved application. In connection with submitting
Measures A and B to the voters, the City Council wished to present to the voters this question of
whether the City should acquire and maintain the Fanita Ranch property in perpetuity as
permanent open space, in the event either Measure A or Measure B does not pass and even if the
acquisition might require a tax increase of up to $150 per unit. This question is presented in
Measure C.

If Measure A or B fails and the voters approve Measure C, Measure C would require the City
Council to pursue the acquisition of the Fanita Ranch property for open space, even if such action
may require an increase of up to $150 per residential unit and commercial, industrial, or
institutional buildings. Passage of Measure C would not in itself constitute a tax levy, but would
require the Council to pursue the acquisition and to consider the $150 unit tax.

If Measure A or B fails and the voters do not approve Measure C, the City Council would not be
required to pursue the acquisition of Fanita Ranch for open space and the property could still
develop pursuant to another application.
