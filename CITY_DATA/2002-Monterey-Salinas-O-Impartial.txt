IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
MEASURE O

Since 1969 the City of Salinas has collected a utility users tax
on certain utility bills. The Salinas City Code sets the current tax
at 6% of the cost of telephone, electricity, gas, water and cable
television services. Since it's inception the tax has provided
between 8.4% and 13.6% of the city's general fund revenue. In
Fiscal Year 2000-2001, the tax provided $ 7,580,675 in annual
revenue, which was 13.05% of the total 2000-2001 general fund
revenue.

General fund revenues are used to provide a range of municipal
services primarily including, but not limited to, police, fire, library,
parks and recreation, maintenance of existing public facilities,
street and sidewalk repair and related public works and
municipal administration.

This measure, if adopted, would amend the Salinas City Code to
eliminate the utility users tax on January 1, 2005. The measure
phases in the elimination of the tax with reductions of 3% upon
the effective date and 1% on January 1, 2004.
