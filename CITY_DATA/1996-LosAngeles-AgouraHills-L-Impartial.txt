The ballot proposition submitted to the voters seeks approval by the voters of an
amendment to the City’s transient occupancy tax ordinance. The transient
occupancy tax is a tax on the privilege of occupying a hotel room in the City. The
current tax rate is 8% of the rent charged by the operator of the hotel to a guest
for the occupancy of a room. The proposed proposition would authorize, but not
require the City Council to increase the tax rate to a maximum of 12%.

A state statute, commonly known as Proposition 62, requires all general taxes
adopted by cities to be approved by a two-thirds vote of the City Council and a
majority of the voters voting on the measure at a special or general municipal
election. General taxes are taxes devoted to general City services (such as police,
fire and park maintenance) and are not restricted to a special or limited purpose.
Although it is not certain that Proposition 62 requires voter approval of increases
to existing taxes, the City Council has decided to seek voter approval of the
proposed amendment to the transient occupancy tax. The City Council approved
the proposed amendment by the required two-thirds vote.

A yes vote on the ballot question authorizes the City Council to increase the rate
of the transient occupancy tax to a maximum of 12%. Whether the tax rate is
actually increased will be decided by the City Council in the future. The Council
would have the discretion to maintain the current rate or establish a rate in any
amount up to a maximum of 12%. Any increase in the rate above 12% would
require new voter approval. A no vote will maintain the rate of the tax at its
current rate of 8%. Currently, the transient occupancy tax generates revenues of
approximately $310,000 per year.
