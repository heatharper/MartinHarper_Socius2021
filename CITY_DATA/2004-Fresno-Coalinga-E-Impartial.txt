IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY

If approved by a majority of the voters at the March 2, 2004 election, Ballot Measure
“E” will allow an increase in Hotel-Motel Tax to become effective. The increase in Hotel-Motel
Tax was contained in Ordinance No. 685 approved by the Coalinga City Council on December 1,
2003, however, is not effective until approved by a majority of the voters at the March 2, 2004
election.

The increase in Hotel-Motel Tax contained in Ballot Measure “E” is a tax in the amount
of ten percent (10%) and will be charged to all hotel, motel and boarding house guests by all
Hotels, Motels and boarding houses located within the City limits of the City of Coalinga. The
current tax is 6% and the ballot measure would increase the Hotel-Motel tax to 10%. The new
increase in Hotel-Motel Tax will be collected and then remitted to the City of Coalinga for use by
the City of Coalinga for general governmental purposes. The increase in Hotel-Motel Tax will
expire automatically after a period of 10 years, and may not be renewed or extended without
additional voter approval at that time. In Ordinance No. 685, approving the Increase in Hotel-Motel Tax, the City Council found and determined that the proceeds of the increase in Hotel-Motel Tax will be essential to maintain continuing City services.
