In 1996, the State’s voters approved Proposition 218 to require majority voter
approval , of local general taxes. The City Council is placing this proposition on
the ballot to allow the voters to decide whether to approve a nonresidential utility
users tax. The utility users tax is a tax on the consumption: of telephone, electricity,
and fuel (gas) services in the City. Cellular telephone charges are excluded from
the tax. The City currently does not have a utility users tax.

If approved by a majority of the voters, the proposition would impose a tax at a
rate not to exceed three percent (3%) of the charges for commercial and industrial
users of telephone, electricity, and fuel services in the City of Agoura Hills.
Residential users would not be subject to the tax. The City Council is authorized
to establish the specific rate of the tax up to three percent (3%). The City Council
also is authorized to repeal the tax. Any tax rate in excess of three percent (3%)
and any tax on additional utility services would require voter approval of another
ballot measure. The proposed tax is estimated to raise approximately $700,000
of tax revenues per year for the City’s general fund.
