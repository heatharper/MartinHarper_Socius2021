CITY OF OJAI
IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY THE CITY ATTORNEY
MEASURE "F"

Measure F (the "Measure") repeals and replaces the City of Ojai,

California’s (“Ojai") current business license ordinance. Similar to the
current ordinance, the Measure requires all persons or entities doing
business in Ojai to obtain and display a business license. Unlike the current
ordinance, however, the Measure permits Ojai to require the payment of a
Twenty-Five Dollars ($25.00) registration fee and an annual renewal fee of
Ten Dollars ($10.00).

Ojai's current business license ordinance assesses a business license tax
on virtually all businesses of Fifty Dollars ($50.00) per year. The tax has not
changed since 1971. The Measure would assess a business license tax
("Annual Tax") based upon eight (8) Annual Tax.categories: Group A
(manufacturing, wholesale and retail business) would pay an Annual Tax of
One Hundred Dollars ($100.00), plus Eight Dollars ($8.00) per full-time
employee. Group B (services, contractors, property rental, entertainment
and utility business) would pay an Annual Tax of One Hundred Dollars
($100.00), plus Ten Dollars ($10.00) per full-time employee. Group C
(professions) would pay an Annual Tax of One Hundred Dollars ($100.00),
plus Twelve Dollars ($12.00) per full-time employee. Group D (amusement
devices) would pay an Annual Tax of One Hundred Dollars ($100.00), plus
Thirty Dollars ($30.00) per each amusement device. Group E (billiard
rooms, pool rooms and bowling alleys) would pay an Annual Tax of One
Hundred Dollars ($100.00) for the first pool table, plus Thirty Dollars
($30.00) for each additional table. Group F (apartment houses, motels and
hotels) would pay an Annual Tax of One Hundred Dollars ($100.00), plus
Twenty-Five Dollars ($25.00) for each living unit. Group G (seasonal and
specialized, e.g„ carnivals, circuses, parking lots) would pay an Annual Tax
of One Hundred Dollars ($100.00), plus Fifty Cents (500) per One Thousand
Dollars ($1,000.00) of gross sales receipts. Group H (out-of-town
contractors) would pay an Annual Tax of One Hundred Dollars ($100.00),
plus Ten Dollars ($10.00) per full-time employee living in the City.

Ojai’s current business license ordinance does not provide a minimum or
maximum tax that may be assessed. The Measure provides for a minimum
annual Tax of One Hundred Eight Dollars ($108.00) and a maximum Annual tax rate of Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00). These minimum and maximum levels may be adjusted each year for inflation.

Both Ojai’s current business license ordinance and the Measure provide that
charitable and non-profit organizations and events are exempt from
licensing and Annual Tax requirements.

The proceeds from the Annual Tax will be used to augment Ojai’s general
fund revenues.
