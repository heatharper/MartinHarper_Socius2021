CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF PROPOSITION E

Proposition E, if approved, would enact Ordinance No. 2376 which provides
(1) an additional flat fee for certain business licenses, (2) a yearly increase in
business licenses and certain taxes based upon the percentage increase of the
Consumer Price Index and real growth and (3) for the deposit of taxes in the
City’s General Fund.

Currently, businesses are required to obtain a business license and to pay business license taxes before conducting business within the City. This ordinance
if enacted, would also require such persons to pay an additional surcharge, or
flat fee, to the City in the amount of Forty Dollars ($40.00) which will be added
to the total of each and every business license effective on January 1, 1989.

This ordinance would also provide for an annual increase in the rates of business licenses beginning January 1, 1989. The percentage of the increase shall
be the percentage increase in the California Consumer Price Index for the year
ended on the prior June 30 less the “real growth” in business license revenues.
“Real growth” in business license revenues would be the year-to-year percent
change in business license revenues, taking into consideration the minimum
annual increase in business licenses taxes, as per the financial statements of
the City at the prior June 30th.

The ordinance further provides that the revenues collected from the taxes
imposed and levied by Title 3, as well as Title 5, of the Azusa Municipal Code
shall be deposited into the General Fund of the City.

The ordinance would also allow the Council to amend the ordinance without
a vote of the people but only to the extent necessary to implement the procedures for collection of the tax and to the extent permitted pursuant to Govern-
ment Code Sections 53720, et seq.
