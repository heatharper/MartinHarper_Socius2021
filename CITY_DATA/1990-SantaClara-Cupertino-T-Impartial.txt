This measure seeks over approval for the acquisition and preservation of the property known as Blackberry Farm for open space, as well as the
acquisition of the Fremont Older Elementary School site and the
construction of public recreation facilities thereon to insure the
preservation of the land as public open space. The cost of these
acquisitions and facilities is estimated to be twenty-five million dollars
which will be financed by the general fund of the city of Cupertino at an
annual cost of approximately 2.3 million dollars per year over a
twenty-five year period.

To augment the general fund of the City of Cupertino, this measure also
seeks voter approval for the imposition of an electric, gas, and telephone
utility user excise tax at a rate not to exceed 2.40% of the monthly bills
for said utility services. The proceeds of the proposed tax will be
deposited into the general fund of the City of Cupertino, but will not be
levied until the City Council has commenced the initial legal action
necessary to insure the acquisition and preservation of Blackberry Farm or
other open-space areas within the City of Cupertino.

Exempted from the tax are residential service users of sixty-five years or
older, religious organizations, and public agencies.

The tax will be automatically repealed twenty-five years after it is first
imposed.

Currently the City of Cupertino has entered into written agreements with
respect to the purchase of Blackberry Farm and the Fremont Older
Elementary School site contingent upon the passage of this measure.
