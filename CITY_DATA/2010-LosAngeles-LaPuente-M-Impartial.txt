CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE M

If adopted, Measure M (Cannabis Business Tax) would amend Title V (Business
Regulation and Licenses) of La Puente’s Municipal Code to add 5.07 and would
establish a new business license tax category of “Cannabis Business” at a tax rate
of ten percent (10%) per $1,000.00 of gross receipts from the businesses’ activity
in La Puente.

If approved, the City will collect a tax on the gross receipts from businesses
engaged in distribution of marijuana for recreational and non-medicinal
purposes, in the event that Proposition 19, a statewide initiative, also known as
“The Regulate, Control and Tax Cannabis Act of 2010”, is passed and adopted
by the voters of the State of California on November 2, 2010. The new Chapter
5.07 will only take effect if Proposition 19 passes. No business license will be
issued under the new Chapter 5.07 until and unless the City Council adopts or
enacts regulations that allow the establishment and operation of Cannabis
Businesses, as defined in Chapter 5.07.

The proposed Cannabis Business license tax is a general tax and the City can use
the tax revenue for any legal municipal purpose. The revenues derived from this
tax will be placed in the City’s general fund for the usual expenses and for
providing essential City services, including but not limited to law enforcement,
code enforcement, building inspection, plan checks, planning, and public works.

The California Constitution, Article XI11(C), Section 2(b) requires that the
electorate approve a general tax by a majority vote before the City can establish
the new tax rates for cannabis businesses.
