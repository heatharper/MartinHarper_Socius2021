CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE G

The City of Cotati currently imposes a tax in the amount of 10% of the rent
charged to persons who stay at a hotel within the Cotati City limits. This tax
is called the transient occupancy tax (“TOT”). The tax is paid by the hotel room
occupant directly to the hotel operator at the time the occupant pays his or her
hotel bill. Hotel operators hold the collected taxes in trust for the benefit of the
City and remit the taxes quarterly to the City tax administrator.

If this measure is approved by the electorate, the TOT shall increase by 2%
from the present 10% rate to 12%. Therefore, if this measure is approved, a
person who stays in a hotel within the City of Cotati will pay 12% of the rent
charged by the hotel operator as a TOT. All of the TOT revenues collected by
the City are used, and shall continue to be used, for City general fund purposes.

The ordinance proposed by this ballot measure will be adopted if this measure
is approved by a simple majority of those electors voting on the measure at the
November 7, 2006 election.

A “yes" vote would approve an increase in the City’s TOT by 2%. A “no” vote
would reject the proposed 2% increase in the City’s TOT.
