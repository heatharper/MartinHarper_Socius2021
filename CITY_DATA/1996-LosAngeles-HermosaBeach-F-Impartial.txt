CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF PROPOSITION F

Proposition F is an ordinance to increase the City’s existing utility users’ tax from
six percent (6%) to eight percent (8%) of utility charges billed to utility consumers
in the City.

The utility users’ tax was originally enacted in 1985 at the rate of six percent (6%)
and applies to telephone, electric, gas, water and cable television utility services.
In 1988, the tax was increased by the voters to ten percent (10%), four percent
(4%) of which was a special tax devoted to paying the debt on the City’s purchase
of the Greenbelt (the railroad right-of-way). That debt was fully repaid late last
year, and as directed by the voters the City Council repealed the four percent
special tax in November, 1995. Accordingly, the City presently imposes a six
percent (6%) tax on utility charges.

If approved by the voters, this ordinance would increase the present tax from six
percent (6%) to eight percent (8%). The tax' revenues' raised by the tax' may be
used by the City for all general municipal purposes.

A “yes” vote is in favor of the increase; a “no” vote is against the increase. The
proposed tax increase is a general tax and therefore the ordinance must receive
a majority vote of those voting on the measure to pass.
