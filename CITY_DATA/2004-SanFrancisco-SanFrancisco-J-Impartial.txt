THE WAY IT IS NOW: There is an 8 1/2% (eight-and-one-half per-
cent) sales tax on most retail goods purchased in San Francisco.
This includes a Statewide 6% sales tax that is controlled and
spent by the State. The remaining 2 1/2% (two-and-one-half per-
cent) sales tax funds are controlled and spent by the City and other
local agencies, including the Bay Area Rapid Transit District, the
San Francisco County Transportation Authority and the San
Francisco Unified School District.

Under State law, the City can increase the local portion of the sales
tax by up to 3/4% (three-quarters-of-one percent), for a total sales
tax of 9 1/4% (nine-and-one-quarter percent).

THE PROPOSAL: Proposition J is an ordinance that would allow
the City to increase the local sales tax by 1/4% (one-quarter-of-one
percent). The total sales tax on most retail goods purchased in
San Francisco would be 83A% (eight-and-three-quarters percent).
The City would control the additional tax funds and could spend
them for any public purpose.

A "YES" VOTE MEANS: If you vote "yes,11 you want to allow the
City to increase the local sales tax by 1/4% (one-quarter-of-one
percent).

A "NO" VOTE MEANS: If you vote "no," you do not want to allow
the City to increase the local sales tax by 1/4% (one-quarter-of-one
percent).
