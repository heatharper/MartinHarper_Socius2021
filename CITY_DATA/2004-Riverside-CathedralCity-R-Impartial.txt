IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE "R

The City currently collects a transient occupancy tax ("TOT") from guests
who spend fewer than 30 consecutive days in certain lodging establishments in the City. Operators of such establishments collect the TOT from
their guests and toward the collected tax to the City for deposit into the
City’s General Fund. A complete description of the TOT is located in
Chapter 3.24 of the City’s Municipal Code, which is accessible on the
City's website at www.cathedralcity.gov.

The City Council spends General Fund monies according to its adopted
budget for the support of the ordinary and necessary operations of the
City, including many public services such as police, fire and paramedic
services, planning and public works, youth and senior programs, etc.
Detailed information concerning the City's budget is a matter of public
record and is available at City Hall and at the Library.

The current TOT rate is 10% of the cost of a room in a lodging establishment. The tax rate has remained unchanged since first imposed in 1981.
This ballot measure places an ordinance before the voters to increase
the TOT rate. If voters approve this measure, the TOT would
incrementally increase to a rate of 11% commencing January 1, 2005,
11.5% commencing January 1, 2006, and, finally, 12% commencing
January' 1,2007.

For example, a hotel guest currently pays $10.00 tax per night on a
$100.00 hotel room. If voters approve this measure, the tax per night on
that room would be $11.00 in 2005, $11.50 in 2006 and $12.00 in 2007.

City staff estimates that voter approval of this measure would increase
General Fund revenues an additional $200,000 to $230,000 per year.

A "yes" vote on this Measure means that the TOT will increase from 10%
to 11% commencing January 1, 2005,11.5% commencing January 1,
2006, and 12% commencing January 1, 2007. A "no" vote on this
Measure means that the TOT will remain at 10%. This ordinance will
become effective only if a majority (at least fifty percent plus one) of the
voters voting in the election approve it.
