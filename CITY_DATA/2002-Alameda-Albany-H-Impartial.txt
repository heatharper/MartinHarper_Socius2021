Impartial Analysis from the City Attorney
The Albany Municipal Code provides for a tax on transfers of real property, as defined in the code. The present rate is eighty five hundredths (85/100) of one percent (1%), or $8.50 per $1,000.00, based on the sale's price or value of consideration.
If this measure is approved by the majority of voters, the tax would be increased to one hundred fifteenths (115/100) of one percent (1%) or $11.50 per $1,000.00, effective January 1, 2003.
This measure also contains a section which modifies how the Albany Municipal Code defines what constitutes a transfer when title to property is held in the name of a business. The proposed measure defines a transaction as a transfer subject to the real property transfer tax when a corporation, partnership, or other business entity owns property in the business entity's name and sells its stock, shares, or interest. For example, if a business entity which owns the racetrack, also owns the real property and sells its stock or shares, a tax would be imposed on the value of the land. If this measure is not approved, then properties held in corporate or business names would not be subject to the transfer tax when the business or corporation is sold. â€¨
