City Attorney’s Impartial Analysis

If approved by a majority of those voting on the measure, Measure C would
authorize the City of St. Helena to levy a one-half of one percent (.5%) transactions
and use tax for a period of five years. Under the ordinance proposed by Measure C,
for a period of five years, a transactions and use tax imposed at the rate of one-half of
one percent (.5%) would be levied on the sale and use of tangible personal property
in St. Helena in conformance with the provisions of the California Revenue and
Taxation Code, similar and in addition to the existing sales and use tax. Proceeds of
the tax would be deposited in the City’s General Fund, and would be available to
pay the City’s general operating expenses. If approved on November 2, 2010, the tax
becomes operative on April 1, 2011. Thereafter, the authority to levy the tax imposed
by the ordinance expires five years from the operative date of the ordinance, that is,
April 1, 2016. The ordinance would also create an “Expenditure Oversight
Committee” comprised of two council members and up to three St. Helena residents
who will be meet quarterly to review revenue received from this tax to insure that
funds are expended in conformance with the General Fund budget.
