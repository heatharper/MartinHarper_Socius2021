IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS FOR MEASURE A TRANSIENT OCCUPANCY TAX INCREASE  

This measure would authorize the City Council of the City of Williams to increase the rate of the transient occupancy tax that is imposed for the privilege of occupying a hotel or motel in the City. Currently, the City levies and collects from each person occupying a hotel or motel in the City a transient occupancy tax in the amount of eight percent of the rent charged by the hotel/motel operator. This measure would increase that tax rate to ten percent. The increased transient occupancy tax would continue to be collected by the hotel/motel operator and then paid to the City. The revenues from the tax would continue to be deposited in the Cityâ€™s general fund to be used for general governmental purposes.
