IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE “C”

The proposed Five-Year Utility Users Tax is a 5% tax on electricity, gas,
water, sewer, telephone and cable television service charges. The tax
will be collected by the utility companies from each customer and then
paid to the City. The Five-Year Utility Users Tax will commence July 1,2005 and expire on June 30, 2010. 


Five-Year Utility Users Tax is a special tax. Fifty percent of the
dues collected under the Five-Year Utility Users Tax shall be used
for resolving the City’s bankruptcy and restructuring the City’s debt and
50 percent shall be used to provide necessary public safety services
such as, but not limited, to police, fire and code enforcement for the
benefit of the City businesses and visitors.

Voting yes for Measure C means the voter approves of the collection of
the Five-Year Utility Users Tax under the new utility users tax ordinance
Voting no for Measure C means the voter does not want the Five-Year
Utility Users Tax enacted.

Since this is a special tax, it must be approved by a two-thirds majority
vote in order to take effect.
