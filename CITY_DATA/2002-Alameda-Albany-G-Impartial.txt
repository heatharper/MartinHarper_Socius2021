Impartial Analysis from the City Attorney
In June, 1997, the voters approved a special tax of $30.84 per residential unit or equivalent residential unit to fund emergency medical services.
This measure, if approved by 2/3 of the voters, would authorize the emergency medical services tax to be increased to a rate not to exceed $57.53 per residential unit or equivalent residential unit.
This measure also modifies the tax formula for commercial properties to one equivalent residential unit for every 1,200 square feet of developed area, rather than the current methodology of two equivalent residential units regardless of size of developed property.
This measure also permits the tax rate to be adjusted on an annual basis, not to exceed 5%, upon the City Council making a finding that the All Urban Consumers San Francisco Bay Area index has increased. â€¨
