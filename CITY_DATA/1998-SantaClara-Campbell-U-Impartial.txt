CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE U

Measure U seeks approval for the City of Campbell to continue to impose the City’s
Transient Occupancy Tax at a rate of ten percent (10%). The Transient Occupancy Tax
is a tax imposed on persons staying in hotels, inns or similar lodging facilities in
Campbell for a period of thirty (30) consecutive days or less. The tax rate is a
percentage of the amount charged for occupying the lodging facilities.

The City first enacted the Transient Occupancy Tax on November 12,1973. The full text
of the ordinance governing the Transient Occupancy Tax is set forth in Chapter 3.34
of the Campbell Municipal Code. On June 6, 1995, the City increased the tax rate from
eight percent (8%) to the current ten percent (10%). This tax is considered a general
tax, which is deposited in the City’s genera! fund, and may be used for any lawful
purpose. Pursuant to California Proposition 218, which was passed by the voters of the
State at the statewide election of November 5,1996, any general tax that was increased
by a city on or after January 1, 1995 must be submitted to the voters for approval in
order for the City to continue to collect the tax after November 6,1998. if the majority
of voters voting on Measure U vote to approve the Measure, then the tax rate will remain
at ten percent (10%). if less than a majority of the voters of voting on Measure U vote
in favor of approving the existing tax rate, then the tax rate will revert to eight percent
(8%).

According to the Finance Department of the City of Campbell, failure to adopt Measure
U will result in a loss of revenue to the City of Campbell in excess of $200,000 per year.
