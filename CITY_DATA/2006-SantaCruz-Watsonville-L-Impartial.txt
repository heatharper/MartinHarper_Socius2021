IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
MEASURE L

If adopted, this Measure would increase the sales tax in Watsonville by one quarter
of one percent (1/4%). The sales tax is sometimes referred to as “transactions and
use tax”. The present sales tax rate in Watsonville is eight percent (8%). This Measure would increase the rate to eight and one quarter percent (8.25%). The proposed increase would be imposed just like the present tax; upon the sale of
tangible personal property sold at retail within the City limits and upon the storage,
use, or other consumption of tangible personal property purchased from any
retailer in the City limits.

All revenue from the proposed tax would go into the City’s General Fund and would
therefore be used by the City to pay for general City operations and services including police, fire, parks, building code enforcement and street repair and improvements. This Measure is therefore a “general purpose tax” rather than a
“special purpose tax” and requires a simple majority vote.

This Measure would be valid and effective if and only if the voters also approve
Measure M which amends Subdivision (b) of the City Charter, capping the City retirement tax. This sales tax would replace part of the revenue lost by capping the
retirement tax.
