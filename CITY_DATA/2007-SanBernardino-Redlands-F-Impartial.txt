MEASURE “F”

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY

Ordinance No. 2664, if approved by the voters of the City of Redlands, would
establish a new business license rate for distribution centers doing business in the
City. The revenue received by the City would be used to defray the costs of providing
City services and supplement the City’s General Fund.

A distribution center is defined as a business which consists primarily of receiving,
temporarily storing and subsequently distributing goods, wares or merchandise.
Presently a distribution center pays an annual license rate of $ 24.00 regardless of the
size of its business. Ordinance No. 2664 would establish a new annual business
license rate of three and one-half cents ($0,035) per square foot of gross floor area
devoted to the distribution of goods, which will be annually increased by the
percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index to the maximum amount of five
cents ($0.05) per square foot of gross floor area. Ordinance No. 2664 further provides
that distribution centers operated solely in support of a wholesale or retail business in
the City are not subject to the new license rate, and distribution centers supporting
wholesale or retail businesses both within and outside the City will have the new
license rate apportioned.

City staff estimates that approximately 7,000,000 square feet of gross floor area of
existing distribution centers within the City would be subject to the new business
license rate. Application of the new business license rate to such distribution centers
would initially result in the City’s receipt of approximately $ 245,000 dollars annually.
