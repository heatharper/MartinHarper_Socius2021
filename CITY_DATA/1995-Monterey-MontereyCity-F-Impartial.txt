IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
PROPOSED CHARTER AMENDMENT MEASURE F
CITY OF MONTEREY

This measure would require the City to increase the Transient Occupancy Tax (TOT), the so-called "room tax", levied on all visitors
staying in hotel/motel rooms. The increase would be 1%. The money
derived from this increase would be split, with 84% of the increase
going to a Visitor Promotion Fund to promote tourism, and the remaining 16% supplementing the general fund to be used to offset
the impacts created by tourists visiting our community. Promotional
funds will not be used to advertise the Cityâ€™s Conference Center, but
will instead be aimed at bringing a broad spectrum of visitors to the
community that will utilize all levels of hotel/motel facilities.

The Visitor Promotion Fund budget shall be recommended by a 7
member panel appointed by the City Council. The Council will approve the budget annually. Promotional funds will be administered by
an organization determined by the City Council.

Like the Neighborhood Improvement Fund, if there are insufficient
funds available to operate the City, the City Council may transfer
funds from the Visitor Promotion Fund to the General Fund, but only
if money is also taken from the Neighborhood Improvement Fund in
at least the same percentage.

This tax will not directly impact residents. It is levied on users of
hotel/motel rooms only.
