MEASURE A

The City of Ceres presently imposes a Transient Occupancy Tax
of five percent (5%) of the rent charged to temporary occupants of
hotel, motel or similar types of temporary lodging facilities. The tax
is a debt owed by the person renting the space, but is collected by
the operator and paid to the City.

Only occupancies of 30 days or less are subject to the tax.
Therefore, the tax is designed to apply to persons who are temporarily
residing in the City as a means of recouping some small portion of
the cost of City services and facilities used by such persons during
their stay in the City.

The tax is assessed only on persons who temporarily rent space
in the City and does not apply to persons who rent homes, apartments
or similar permanent living accommodations.

All revenues saved from the tax become part of the City’s General
Fund which may be used for any municipal purpose approved by
the City Council.

If adopted by a majority of those persons voting at the election,
City of Ceres Measure A will amend the City’s Transient Occupancy
Tax rate from five percent (5%) to eight percent (8%). There has
been no increase in the City’s Transient Occupancy Tax rate since
November of 1971, a period in excess of 30 years. The City’s current
tax rate is among the lowest in the State of California. Approval of
Measure A will make the City’s Transient Occupancy Tax rate
consistent with the majority of California cities.
