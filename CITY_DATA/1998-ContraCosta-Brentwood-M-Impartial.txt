OF MEASURE M

Measure “M” on the ballot provides: “Shall the proposed ordinance to protect funding for parks in the City
of Brentwood be approved?”

The full text of the proposed ordinance follows this Impartial Analysis. The ordinance will not be effective
unless and until approved by a vote of not less than a majority of those voting on this Measure and provided
further that this Measure receives more affirmative votes than Measure “N” which also appears on the ballot.

The ordinance is on the ballot because the City Council requested it to be submitted to the voters.

The ordinance would authorize the City to continue with City-Wide Park Maintenance Assessment District
98-1. In April 1998, Brentwood property owners voted to assess themselves a maximum $79 a year, per
single family dwelling, to maintain park and recreational facilities in Brentwood. Other land uses, such as
multi-family, commercial, public property and agricultural, were also assessed at different amounts. This
City-Wide Park Maintenance Assessment District 98-1 is currently in full force and effect.

The ordinance is directly contrary to Measure “N” which is also on the ballot. Measure “N” seeks to
terminate City-Wide Park Maintenance Assessment District 98-1. This ordinance seeks to confirm the
District. Even if this ordinance and Measure “N” both fail to receive a majority vote, City-Wide Park
Maintenance Assessment District 98-1 would continue in full force and effect.

A 'yes’ vote means you are in favor of Measure “M” and the City’s park maintenance funding program and
a ‘no’ vote means you are opposed to Measure “M” and opposed to the City’s park maintenance funding
program
