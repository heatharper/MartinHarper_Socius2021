Impartial Analysis from the City Attorney
Chapter 3.18 of the Union City Municipal Code now provides for a tax payable by persons occupying hotel or motel rooms in Union City at a rate of six and one-half percent (6.5%) of the room rate. The tax is collected from the hotel/motel guest by the hotel/motel operator and then paid to the city every three months. Persons whose stay in the hotel or motel lasts longer than thirty(30) consecutive days are exempt from the tax. The 6.5% rate has been in effect since 1983.
This tax is not a special tax, but is a general tax deposited in the general fund for general government purposes. Nor is it a tax upon real property. As required by state-wide Propositions 218 and 62, such a tax may only be imposed or increased by a vote of the people at a regular municipal election. As it is a general tax and as it is not a tax involving real property, it may be increased by a simple majority vote.
Measure E amends Chapter 3.18 of the Union City Municipal Code by increasing the tax rate from 6.5% to 8.5% of the hotel/motel room charges. For example, under the current rate, a hotel/motel patron pays a room tax of $3.25 per night on a $50.00 per night hotel/motel room. If passed, Measure E would increase that tax by $1.00 to $4.25 per night on that same $50.00 per night hotel/motel room.
