Impartial Analysis of Measure R	

The City Council of the City of Pacifica has placed this measure on the
ballot to ask the voters of Pacifica to approve an amendment to the City’s
transient occupancy tax ordinance to increase the transient occupancy
tax rate from the current 10% to 12%. The transient occupancy tax is
that tax placed upon the room rent charged to hotel guests in the City of
Pacifica. Hotels in Pacifica collect the tax from hotel guests as part of
the charge to be paid by the guests for occupancy of their hotel room.

The City estimates that the increase of the transient occupancy tax from
10% to 12% would generate approximately $160,000 dollars per year.
Because the transient occupancy tax is a general tax and not a special
tax, the additional revenue generated would be deposited into the City’s
general fund for general governmental purposes and can be used for
any legal City purpose.

Because the additional tax revenue would be used for general City
governmental purposes, a simple majority vote of those persons voting
on the measure is required to approve the measure. And, because the
tax would be adopted by a vote of the people, the tax rate could not be
increased again unless approved by another vote of the people.

A YES vote approves the measure.

A NO vote rejects the measure
