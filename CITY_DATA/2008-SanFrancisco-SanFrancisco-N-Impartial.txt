THE WAY IT IS NOW: Under authority granted by state law, the
City imposes a transfer tax on the sale of real estate in San
Francisco. The tax rate ranges from 0.50% to 0.75%, depending
on the value of the real estate. The 0.75% rate applies to the sale
of real estate worth $1 million or more. The transfer tax also
applies to real estate leases with a term of more than 50 years.

The proceeds from the transfer tax go into the City’s General
Fund.

THE PROPOSAL: Proposition N would increase the transfer tax
rate to 1.5% for the sale of real estate worth $5 million or more.
The Board of Supervisors could exempt the sale of affordable
housing projects from this increase. Proposition N would not
increase the tax rate for the sale of real estate worth less than $5
million. Proposition N would extend the transfer tax to real estate
leases of 35 years or more.

In addition, Proposition N would reduce the transfer tax for the sale
of residential property by up to 1/3 if, after January 1, 2009, the
person selling the real estate had:

•	installed a solar energy system or

•	made improvements to increase earthquake safety.

A “YES” VOTE MEANS: If you vote "yes," you want to increase
the transfer tax rate to 1.5% for sales of real estate worth more
than $5 million and reduce the tax by up to 1/3 for sales of residential property with solar energy systems or earthquake safety
improvements.

A “NO” VOTE MEANS: If you vote “no,” you do not want to make
these changes.
