Impartial Analysis of Measure S

The California Constitution and state law authorize the voters of
a town, by a two-thirds majority, to approve a parcel tax for specified
purposes.

This measure would extend, for four years, at the current rates, a parcel
tax for the following purposes: (1) police emergency response services; (2)
street repair and maintenance; (3) drainage facility repair and maintenance
and (4) capital improvements.

Before levying the parcel tax, the City Council must adopt an annual
budget. It must then hold a duly noticed public hearing on the proposed
tax. The tax may not exceed the amount the City Council determines to be
necessary to provide adequate levels of the municipal services and capital
improvements described above, after deducting the projected revenue to be
gathered from other sources.

The tax on individual parcels may not exceed in any year the amounts
set forth in Section 4 of the proposed ordinance authorizing the tax. A copy
of the ordinance is included in the ballot materials.

The tax will be a lien on individual parcels and may be collected by
the Town or the County Tax Collector at the option of the City Council.

Any monies raised by this parcel tax will be deposited in a special
fund and may be used only for the described municipal services and capital
improvements.

Authority to levy this tax will commence for the fiscal year 2010-2011
and will expire after fiscal tax year 2013-2014.

A “yes” vote is a vote to maintain the Town’s special parcel tax at its
current levels.

A “no” vote is a vote to end the levy of a special parcel tax for the
Town.
