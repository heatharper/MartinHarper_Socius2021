IMPARTIAL CITY ATTORNEY ANALYSIS
MEASURE"G"

TRANSACTIONS AND USE TAX FOR ROAD
MAINTENANCE AND CODE ENFORCEMENT

Measure G is a one percent (1%) transactions and use tax to be used only
for road maintenance and code enforcement in the City of Clearlake. This
tax is a “special tax’ rather than a “general tax," which means that revenues from the tax would be deposited into a special fund separate from the
City’s general fund to be used only for road maintenance and code enforcement, in accordance with the City of Clearlake Road Maintenance
and Code Enforcement Transactions and Use Tax Expenditure Plan (“Expenditure Plan”). The Expenditure Plan is available for review at City Hall,
and details specifically how the proceeds of the tax will be spent for road
maintenance and code enforcement for the first five years of expenditures.
The Expenditure Plan may be amended once each year, through an ordinance adopted by the City Council following a duly noticed public hearing.

State law authorizes cities to adopt transactions and use tax ordinances
with voter approval and to have those taxes administered by the State
Board of Equalization. Pursuant to state law, Measure G was placed on
the ballot by the City Council to ask the voters of Clearlake to approve the
tax at a rate of one percent (1%). The tax would be added to the current
sales and use tax rate in the City of 7.75%, and would be collected at the
same time and in the same manner as the existing sales and use tax.

A “yes” vote is a vote to approve adoption of the proposed one percent
(1%) transactions and use tax, the proceeds to be used for road maintenance and code enforcement only. A “no” vote is a vote to reject the adoption of the tax. Measure G will be approved if at least two-thirds (2/3) of the
voters voting on Measure G at the November 6,2012 election, vote yes.
