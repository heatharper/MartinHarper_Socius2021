IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE T

The initiative proposes a $59.00 per parcel special tax on all parcels of
real property in the City of San Carlos. The parcel tax would commence
July 1, 2005 for the 2005-2006 fiscal year and continue for five (5)
consecutive years terminating June 30, 2010.

The funds received are earmarked to be spent only for the operation of
the SCOOT shuttle bus program, which would be a free public shuttle bus
service in the City of San Carlos.

Parcels owned by church, religious, government and public utilities
would be exempt from the tax.

This initiative requires a two-thirds (2/3) majority vote to pass. If
adopted, the initiative can only be amended by another voter initiative also
requiring a two thirds (2/3) vote.
