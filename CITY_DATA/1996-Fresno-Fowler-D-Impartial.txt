CITY OF FOWLER MEASURE D

(Impartial Analysis by City Attorney)

The Fowler Municipal Code provides for the collection of transient occupancy taxes. Transient occupancy
taxes are taxes collected for the City by hotel operators upon the occupancy of a hotel room for thirty (30)
consecutive days or less. A hotel is broadly defined to include all buildings designed for dwelling, lodging or
sleeping purposes and includes any hotel, inn, motel, lodging house, rooming house, apartment house,
dormitory and mobile home at a fixed location. The taxes collected are placed in the Cityâ€™s General Fund which
can be used for general municipal purposes. The existing tax rate is four (4%) percent of the room rent
charged by the operator and is paid by the occupant. If Measure D passes, the tax rate will be increased to
ten (10%) percent.
