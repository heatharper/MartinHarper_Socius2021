CITY ATTORNEY'S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS

Roseville currently has a Hotel Tax for the privilege of occupying a room in any hotel in the City. The amount of the tax
is currently set at six percent (6%) of the rental charged by
the Hotel operator. The tax is paid by the person renting the
hotel room. Thus, Roseville residents who do not utilize any
of the hotels in the City will not be impacted by this measure.
The tax is collected by the hotel operator as a part of the bill
for the room rental. The six percent (6%) rate was established
in 1975, and has not been increased since.

This measure would amend the Roseville Municipal Code to
raise the amount of the Hotel Tax collected to ten percent
(10%) of the room charge. Hotel Tax rates range from 6% to
12% within the Sacramento region. Only the Cities of
Roseville and Yuba City currently have rates of 6%. An
increase to a 10% Hotel Tax rate would place Roseville in the
mid-range of communities which collect such taxes.

The revenue generated from the Hotel Tax is placed in the
City's General Fund, and is used to pay for a variety of public
facilities and services.
