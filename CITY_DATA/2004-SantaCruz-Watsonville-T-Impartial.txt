Impartial Analysis from City Attorney


This ballot measure, if adopted, would repeal the City of Watsonville Emergency Response Fee set forth in Chapter 3-15 of the Watsonville Municipal Code. The fee is used to pay for a portion of the City's share of the cost of operating the Santa Cruz Consolidated Emergency Communications Center, Joint Powers Authority. The fee is collected with the telephone bill. The fee is $2.00 per month per residential account line; $2.00 per business access line, not to exceed $18.00 per month; and $18.00 per month per account per service location.
