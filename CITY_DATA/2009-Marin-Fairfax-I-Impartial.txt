TOWN ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS
OF MEASURE I

This measure, if passed by two-thirds (2/3) of the voters, would amend Sections 3.20.080 and 3.20.090 of the
Fairfax Town Code, extending an existing special tax at a
maximum rate of One Hundred Twenty-Five Dollars
($125.00) on each residential dwelling unit and each separate business occupancy within the boundaries of the
Town of Fairfax for a period of five (5) years. The measure requires that the revenue from the tax be used exclusively for the specific purposes of maintaining 24-hour,
seven days per week staffing of the Police and Fire
Services, performing Public Works safety improvements,
providing matching funds for state and federal grants, and
revitalizing Youth programs, which will be overseen by a
citizens oversight committee to ensure that the tax revenue is spent accordingly.

A “YES” vote would be a vote to extend the tax, sub-
ject to the conditions and restrictions stated above.

A “NO” vote would be a vote to not extend the tax.
