IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
MEASURE Q

TRANSIENT OCCUPANCY TAX (“TOT”) INCREASE

Pursuant to Santa Cruz Municipal Code Chapter 3.28, since 1991 the City of Santa
Cruz has levied a 10% transient occupancy tax on each hotel or motel guest in the
City. This ballot measure, if approved by City voters, would increase the tax rate
from 10% to 11 % of the rent charged by the hotel or motel operator.

The transient occupancy tax constitutes a general tax meaning that all tax revenue
is deposited in the City’s General Fund and is available to pay for the costs of all
City operations and programs including police and fire protection, parks and
recreation programs, economic and employment development, and other essential
City services. This ballot measure therefore proposes a “general purpose tax”
rather than a “special purpose tax” and requires a simple majority vote for adoption.

While City voters will also be asked to vote on Santa Cruz County Ballot Measure N
which proposes a County transient occupancy tax increase to an 11% tax rate,
similar to that proposed by the City in this ballot measure, hotel/motel guests in the
City would only be required to pay the City tax and hotel/motel guests in the
unincorporated County would only be required to pay the County tax.

Since a substantial percentage of the City’s hotel/motel guests are non-City
residents who are tourists or City visitors, a substantial portion of the increased tax
revenue generated by this initiative, if adopted by the voters, would be paid by
non-City residents despite the fact that all such proceeds will underwrite the costs
of providing municipal services to City residents.
