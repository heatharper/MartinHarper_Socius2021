IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY CITY OF SALINAS MEASURE C  


The existing Salinas business License Tax rates were established by Ordinance No. 2231, adopted by the City Council on august 16, 1994. Ordinance No. 2231 and its tax rates were subject to a "sunset provision" which would have eliminated the increased rates on June 30, 1996.  However, on November 21, 1995, the Council adopted Ordinance No. 2271, which deleted the "sunset provision" in Ordinance No. 2231 and extended the Business License Tax increase. Salinas currently continues to assess the 1994 increased business License Tax rate.  Proposition 218, adopted on November 5, 1996 requires that the Council action adopting Ordinance No. 2271 and extending the Business License Tax increase be approved by a majority vote in a City election.  This measure, if adopted, would allow Salinas to continue to collect the Business License Tax at the rate established in 1994 by Ordinance No. 2231. If this measure is not adopted, Salinas would continue to collect the Business License Tax at pre 1994 rates and may have to reduce municipal services to reflect the approximately $650,000 estimated annual revenue loss if rates were rolled back to the pre 1994 rates.
