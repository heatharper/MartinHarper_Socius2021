IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
MEASURE B

City of Belvedere
Increase in Fire and Emergency Medical Services Levy

This ballot measure authorizes the Belvedere City Council to adopt an
ordinance amending and readopting existing Chapter 3.28 of the
Belvedere Municipal Code, effectively increasing the City’s existing tax
that funds fire protection and emergency medical services for the City.
The amended ordinance would be effective starting with the fiscal year
beginning July 1,2000.

If the measure is adopted, the City Council would be authorized, for
any fiscal year where it is determined that the cost of providing safe,
adequate and proper fire protection and emergency medical services for
the City will exceed $400,000, to impose a tax to fund such services on
each parcel of real property within the City. The maximum tax allowed to
be collected for the fiscal year 2000/2001 would be $450,000. The levy
would result in the following rate structure for the fiscal year 2000/2001:
$395.00 per residential dwelling unit; $450.00 per commercial
occupancy; and $80.00 per vacant parcel of land. After fiscal year
2000/2001, the maximum tax may be adjusted as if it were an
appropriation subject to the limitation of the provisions of California
Constitution Article XIIIB.

This measure would also increase the City’s appropriations limit to the
extent of the proceeds derived from the increased tax, for the four fiscal
years beginning July 1,2000 and ending June 30,2004.

Article XIIIA of the California Constitution requires that this measure
must be approved by a two-thirds majority of the electors voting on the
measure on April 11,2000.

If approved, this measure would supersede the City of Belvedere’s
existing tax for fire protection and emergency medical services.

A “Yes” vote on this measure authorizes the City to increase its
existing levy for fire protection and emergency medical services
beginning with the fiscal year commencing July 1,2000.

A “No” vote on this measure prohibits the City from increasing its
existing levy for fire protection and emergency medical services
beginning with the fiscal year commencing July 1,2000.
