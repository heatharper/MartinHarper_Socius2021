MEASURE D

Current City ordinance imposes a 10% tax on the users of hotels,
motels and similar commercial facilities within the City. The tax is
imposed on the amount charged by the operator for lodging. Guests
staying less than 30 consecutive days must pay the tax. The tax
is collected by the operator of the facility, and transferred to the
City. Currently, the City spends approximately 20% of the revenue
collected on programs to promote economic development and
tourism. The balance of the revenue goes into the City's General
Fund and is used to provide City services.

Measure D would increase the tax on temporary users of hotels,
motels, etc. to 12%.
