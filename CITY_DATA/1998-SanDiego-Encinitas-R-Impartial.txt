CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS

EXISTING LAW: The City of Encinitas currently imposes a tax on a hotel guest who rents a unit in
a hotel for 30 days or less. “Hotel” includes motels, apartments, and lodging houses of three units
or more. The current tax is equal to 8% of the rent charged by the hotel operator. The tax revenue
is useable by the City for any municipal purpose.

EFFECT OF MEASURE ON EXISTING LAW: If two-thirds of the votes cast on this measure are
“yes," then, commencing on January 1, 1999, the hotel guest will pay an additional tax equal to
2% of the rent charged by the hotel operator. The tax revenue from this additional tax would be
useable by the City only for beach and sand replenishment and stabilization projects.

FISCAL IMPACT: Undetermined. The amount of tax revenue that will result from the proposed 2%
tax cannot be determined in advance of knowing the amount of rents received by hotel operators.
