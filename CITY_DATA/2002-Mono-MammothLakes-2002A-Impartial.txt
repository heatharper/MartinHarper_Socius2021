Town Attorney's Impartial Analysis: Measure 2002-A

Under existing law, the Town of Mammoth Lakes imposes a Transient Occupancy Tax (Bed Tax)
at the rate of 10%. The California Supreme Court has ruled that local taxes may not be raised
without a vote of the people. The Town Council has unanimously voted to place the matter of
increasing the Transient Occupancy Tax from 10% to 12% before the voters.

If Measure 2002-A passes, the Transient Occupancy Tax will be increased from 10% to 12%. The
12% rate will remain in effect until June 30, 2011, at which time the rate will be reduced to 11%
as required by the sunset provision of a prior voter-approved Transient Occupancy Tax measure.

If Measure 2002-A fails the Transient Occupancy Tax will remain at 10% until June 30, 2011, at
which time the rate will be reduced to 9% as required by the sunset provision of a prior voter-
approved Transient Occupancy Tax measure.

A "YES" vote is a vote to increase the Transient Occupancy Tax rate from 10% to 12%. The
increase in tax rate will provide additional general fund revenues both to maintain existing
programs and to support future programs and services determined necessary by the Town Council.

A "NO" vote is a vote to not raise the Transient Occupancy Tax rate. No additional general fund
revenues will be generated. The Town Council will not have such additional revenues available
to either support existing programs or to support future programs and services.
