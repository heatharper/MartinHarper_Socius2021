IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
CITY OF OAKDALE, MEASURE E

AMENDING TRANSIENT TAX RATE


Measure "E”: Shall an ordinance amending Section 11-14 of the Code of
the City of Oakdale, providing that "for the privilege and occupancy in any
hotel, each transient is subject and shall pay a tax in the amount of 10% of
the rent charged by the operator”, be adopted? If Measure “E” passes, the
transient occupancy tax rate as set forth in Section 11-14 of the Oakdale
City Code would be increased from 7% to 10%.
