

MEASURE “F”

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY TOWN ATTORNEY

Currently, the transient occupancy tax charged to each transient is seven percent (7%)
of the rent charged (hotel tax). This proposed Ordinance would increase the amount of the
transient occupancy tax from seven percent (7%) to nine percent (9%) of the rent charged.
In order for this Ordinance to be adopted by the people, it must receive a majority of those
persons voting on this matter.
