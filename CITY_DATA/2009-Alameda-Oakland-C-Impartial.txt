Summary Prepared by Oakland City Attorney
This proposed ordinance would amend the City of Oakland's transient occupancy tax (Hotel Tax) to provide an additional surcharge of 3% that will be paid by persons who stay in any single Oakland hotel for less than 30 consecutive days in order to provide funding to the Oakland Zoo, Oakland Museum, the Chabot Space and Science Center, cultural arts programs and festivals and the Oakland Convention and Visitor's Bureau. The Current hotel taxis 11%. The revenue from the 3% surcharge will be allocated as follows: 50% to the Oakland Convention and Visitor's Bureau, and 12.5% each to the Oakland Zoo, the Oakland Museum of California, the Chabot Space and Science Center and cultural arts programs and festivals. The language "cultural arts programs and festivals" is broad and would allow the City to distribute this category of funds to outside organizations or to programs operated directly by the City. The measure also does not provide specificity regarding the criteria for allocating this category of revenue; nor does it identify the decision-making process by which these funds will be distributed. The City does have an existing process under the Cultural Funding Program of the City's Cultural Arts and Marketing Division and the cultural arts programs' funds could be distributed through this program.
