IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE T

Ballot Measure T presents the voters with the option of ratifying and re-adopting the City’s existing 10% transient occupancy tax. The transient
occupancy tax is paid by persons who stay at hotels in the City and not by
property owners.

The City last adjusted the rate of the transient occupancy tax in 1990. That year,
the City Council adopted an ordinance increasing the amount of the tax from 6%
to 10% of the rent charged by the hotel operator. Although the City has
collected the transient occupancy tax from hotel guests at the 10% rate from that
time to the present, recent court decisions now forbid the City from continuing
to impose the tax at that rate without voter approval.

This Measure, if adopted, would constitute a formal approval by the voters of the
City Council’s 1990 increase of the transient occupancy tax and the City’s
subsequent collection of the tax at the 10% rate. This Measure, if adopted, also
would re-adopt Westlake Village Municipal Code Section 6.4.020, which
currently imposes the 10% transient occupancy tax. Such re-adoption would
allow the City to collect the tax at the 10% rate in the future. Such re-adoption
additionally would enable the City Council to reduce the tax, and to otherwise
adjust the tax to any rate less than or equal to 10%, without further voter
approval.

This Measure, if adopted, would not allow the City Council to increase the rate
of the transient occupancy tax in excess of 10% without voter approval.

A “yes” vote on Measure T enacts an ordinance ratifying and re-adopting the
City’s existing 10% transient occupancy tax. A “no” vote reduces the transient
occupancy tax to its pre 1990 rate of 6%.
