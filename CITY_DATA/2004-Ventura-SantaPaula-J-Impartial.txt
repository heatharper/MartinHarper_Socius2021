CITY OF SANTA PAULA IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS PREPARED BY THE CITY ATTORNEY MEASURE "J"  



If enacted, Measure J will impose a new general tax on the use of gas, electricity, cable television, and telephone services. Measure J defines all such services as “utility services."  The amount of the general tax would be $6.00 per month on each utility service account with a billing address located within the City’s jurisdiction. Measure J refers to this tax as a “Utility User Tax" or “UUT.“ In public reports, the City estimates that the UUT would generate total revenue of approximately $2,224,500 each year. This revenue could be used for the City's general governmental purposes.  If enacted, Measure J would also cause creation of a seven member oversight committee. Members serving on the Measure J Oversight Committee would represent several different community interests and be responsible for providing public reports regarding the City’s use of UUT revenue. The City’s elected officials are ineligible to participate on the Measure J Oversight Committee. All meetings of the Measure J Oversight Committee would conform with California open meeting laws.  Unless extended by voter approval in November 2008, Measure J would be automatically repealed on December 31,2009.  To be adopted, Measure J must be approved by a simple majority of the voters in the City of Santa Paula.  A "yes" vote on Measure J favors imposition of the UUT.  A “no” vote on Measure J opposes imposition of the UUT.
