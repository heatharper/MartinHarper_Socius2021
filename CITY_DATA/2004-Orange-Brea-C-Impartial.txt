

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE C
BY CITY ATTORNEY

The City currently imposes a business license tax on service and
professional businesses conducted within the City, based on various
formulae.

Measure C increases the amount of business license taxes required for
retail, wholesale, manufacturing, services, coin operated machines,
contracting, building, rental and seasonal businesses. Measure C also
places a tax on oil wells and per barrel of oil produced. The increases take
effect in phases over approximately a two-year period of time. Measure C
provides for future adjustments in business license taxes proportionate to
the increase in the cost of living index.

The additional business license taxes paid would be general taxes, the
revenues from which would be placed into the General Fund of the City, and
the City would be permitted to use the revenues for any valid municipal
purpose. This measure would take effect only if approved by a majority of
those voting on the measure at the November 2, 2004 General Municipal
Election.
