IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY THE TOWN ATTORNEY
MEASURE C

If this measure is approved by the requisite two-thirds vote, an
ordinance shall be adopted in the Town of Code Madera imposing a
special tax for paramedic and/or emergency medical services (EMS).
This is not the first time an EMS tax has been submitted to and
approved by the Town’s voters. A special EMS tax was first approved
by the Town’s voters on June 7, 1983 and has since received
continuous voter approval. The present special EMS tax was approved
by the Town's voters in November of 1998, Since that tax will expire on
June 30, 2003, voter approval of this measure is required in order to
continue the provision of EMS services.

If approved, this measure will impose a yearly tax for EMS services
for the next four fiscal years. For fiscal year 2003-2004, the tax amount
will be $30.00 for each residential unit. For nonresidential uses, the tax
rate for fiscal year 2003-2004 will be $30.00 per 1,000 square feet of
enclosed floor area. The tax rate on residential and nonresidential uses
shall increase $5.00 per year for each of the remaining three years the
tax is in effect. In fiscal year 2006-2007, the yearly tax shall be $45.00
for each residential unit and $45.00 for each 1,000 square feet of
enclosed floor area for nonresidential uses.

The measure provides that the tax proceeds must be placed in a
special fund which may only be used for the provisions of EMS
services. The tax amount specified above may not be increased without
the approval of two-thirds of the Town voters. The measure also
provides that the EMS tax will be collected by the Marin County Tax
Collector along with the property tax. As stated above, the tax will
automatically terminate on June 30,2007.
