IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
MEASURE B
City of Carmel-by-the-Sea

MEASURE TO AMEND THE CITY OF CARMEL-BY-THE-SEA
MUNICIPAL CODE, SECTIONS 5.08.010 AND 5.08.020 RELATING TO
BUSINESS LICENSE TAXES, LICENSES, AND REGULATIONS TO
INCREASE BUSINESS LICENSE TAXES CHARGED TO BUSINESSES
OPERATING WITHIN THE CITY WHEREIN TAXES COLLECTED WILL
BE USED FOR GENERAL CITY SERVICES

The Measure proposes to amend the City of Carmel-by-the-Sea's
Municipal Code related to Business License Taxes, Licenses, and
Regulations to increase the business license tax for all general business
classifications with the exception of special events and transportation of
persons/goods and teachers having less than 10 pupils. The business
license tax is proposed to increase to $1.00 per $1,000 of gross receipts
per year with funds to be used for general City services.

Section 5.08.010 identifies general business classifications that would
pay the proposed increased license fee. The section does not exempt
or preclude any business that is not specifically listed in the section
from being subject to the proposed business license tax increase of
$1.00 per $1,000 of gross receipts per year; however, special events
and transportation of persons/goods are specifically exempt from the
proposed business license tax.

Section 5.08.020 identifies specific businesses that shall not be subject
to the proposed tax rate. In addition to exemptions noted in Section

5.08.010	the section states that teachers having less than 10 pupils shall
not be subject to the tax rate.

Under the City’s present Municipal Code related to Business License
Taxes, Licenses, and Regulations, the business license tax rate is
currently $.88 per $1,000 of gross receipts per year.

A vote FOR this Measure will amend the City’s Municipal Code (Sections

5.08.010 and 5.08.020) to approve an increase the Business License
Tax rate to $1.00 per $1,000 of gross receipts per year for all general
businesses operating within the City unless specifically exempted as
noted in Sections 5.08.010 and 5.08.020.

A vote AGAINST this Measure will not amend the City’s Municipal Code
(Sections 5.08.010 and 5.08.020) and will not approve a business license
tax increase to $1.00 per $1,000 of gross receipts per year for all general
businesses operating with the City as noted in Sections 5.08.010 and
5.08.020.
