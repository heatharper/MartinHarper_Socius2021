IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
MEASURE I

THE TULARE VITAL CITY SERVICES MEASURE

The Tulare Vital City Services Measure proposes to raise revenue by authorizing a general
transactions and use tax ("sales tax") of one-half of a cent (.50 percent), and approving an
ordinance adding Chapter 5.78 to Title 5 of the Tulare Municipal Code. The tax would be paid in addition to the current state and local sales taxes and would be collected at the same time and
in the same manner as existing sales taxes.

California Revenue and Taxation Code Section 7285.9 authorizes the City to levy or increase a
transactions and use tax (i.e. "sales tax") at a rate of .25 percent or multiple thereof, for the
general purposes of the city, if the ordinance proposing the tax is approved by a majority of the
qualified voters of the city voting in an election on that issue. If approved by the voters, the sales
tax will become effective no sooner than April 1, 2006.

The revenues from this tax are not designated for any specific purpose. The revenues may be
used for general city functions, such as police protection including anti-gang programs, fire
suppression and paramedic services, street and pothole repair, city park maintenance and
repairs, the library, recreation, tree trimming, code enforcement and other services.

The sales tax increase will be subject to certain conditions. The revenues and expenditures shall
be independently audited on an annual basis. Additionally, an independent citizenâ€™s oversight
committee shall review the revenues and expenditures, and the findings of the auditor and
oversight committee shall be reviewed by the City Council and made available to the public. The
City Council may, by resolution and after public notice and a public hearing, reduce said tax to
one-quarter of a cent (.25 percent).
