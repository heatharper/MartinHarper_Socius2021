CITY ATTORNEYâ€™S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE E

Under Articles 13A and 13C of the California Constitution, local special taxes
require two-thirds voter approval. The City Council is placing this proposition
on the ballot to allow the voters to decide whether to approve a parcel tax for
special library purposes. The proposition defines special library purposes as the
acquisition, lease, construction, operation and maintenance of library facilities,
including the cost of fixtures, furnishings, books, and other resources to be used
for the provision of special library services in the City.

If approved by two-thirds of the voters, the proposition would allow the collection
of a parcel tax at a rate not to exceed $45 per parcel in the City of Agoura Hills.
The City Council is authorized to establish the specific tax rate up to $45 per
parcel. The City Council also is authorized to repeal the tax. Any tax in excess
of $45 per parcel would require voter approval of another ballot measure. The
tax would stay in effect only until June 30,2003, at which time it could be extended
only pursuant to all applicable procedures then in effect. The proposed tax is
estimated to raise approximately $270,000 of tax revenues per year for special
library purposes in the City.
