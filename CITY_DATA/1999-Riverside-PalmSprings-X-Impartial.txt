IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE “X"

The City Attorney's Impartial Analysis under Measure "W discusses
the background of the Utility Tax generally.

This Measure “X" is also an Advisory Measure which would continue
the Utility Tax at 5% with no sunset clause. However, this Measure
contains an additional provision advising the City that at least 50% of the
revenues raised from the Utility Tax should be spent for Public Safety.

Public Safety, though not defined, would generally include law
enforcement. fire safety, paramedic, animal regulation, dispatch;
communication, emergency services, disaster preparedness, and
related matters.

Currently, of the City's $32.6 Million general fund budget, over 50%
is expended to support Public Safety services. This Measure would
direct that 50% of the Utility Tax would be spent for such services.

In the event two or more of Measures "W." “X,“ and T are
approved, generally, in the event of conflicts between the measures, the
measure with the most votes would prevail. It is also a rule of statutory
construction that the more specific measure prevails over the more
general

The passage of this advisory measure would not make the City's
Utility Tax a special tax subject to a requirement for 2/3 voter approval
under Proposition 218. In 1998 the Court of Appeals ruled in Coleman v
County of Santa Clara that a sales tax was not converted to a special tax
because the voters in an advisory measure expressed their desire to
have the tax revenue spent for transportation purposes. In this case this
would be a similar expression of intent by the voters of Palm Springs.

This measure is advisory and not binding on the City Council.
