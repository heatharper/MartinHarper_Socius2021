Impartial Analysis from City Attorney
The City currently collects a transient occupancy tax ("TOT") from transients, who are defined as those individuals occupying hotel rooms within the City for fewer than thirty (30) days. The transient pays the tax to the hotel, and the hotel pays the tax to the City. The City deposits the revenue into its General Fund, which supports a wide range of City services, including police and fire protection, youth recreation, and senior activities. City staff estimates that a 1% reduction in the TOT would result in the loss of approximately $90,000 a year to the City's General Fund.
The TOT is currently charged in the amount of 10% of the cost of the hotel room. Because TOT is deposited into the General Fund, it is a general tax. A complete description of the TOT is located in Chapter 3.24 of the City's Municipal Code, which may be found on the City's website at "www.morgan-hill.ca.gov."
In 1972, the voters adopted the TOT and established a 9% tax rate. In March 1991, the TOT was increased from 9% to 10% by the City Council. Proposition 218, adopted in November 1996, requires such increases to have voter approval, as does Proposition 62, adopted by initiative measure in November 1986. However, courts found Proposition 62 to be unconstitutional and it was not declared to be enforceable until 1995, when the California Supreme Court overturned lower court decisions declaring the measure unconstitutional. Since 1995, other court decisions have created uncertainty as to whether a general tax increased prior to the adoption of Proposition 218 and the date Proposition 62 was declared constitutional, requires voter approval.
This measure places an ordinance before the voters to validate and re-enact the 10% TOT rate.
