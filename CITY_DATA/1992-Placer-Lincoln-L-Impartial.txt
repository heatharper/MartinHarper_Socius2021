IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS
MEASURE L

If this Measure is approved by a majority of the voters voting in this election, the City's
Business License Tax for most businesses will be increased.

In order to conduct business, each business in the City is required to pay a business
license tax in an amount set out in the City's Municipal Code. Approval of this Measure (Ordinance
575 B) will increase the Business License Tax for most businesses in varying amounts, depending
on the nature of the business.

The annual business license tax for businesses operating a motel, hotel or trailer park
will increase from five dollars ($5) per unit available for rent to ten dollars ($10) per unit.
The annual business license tax for those businesses which utilize vehicles and have no fixed
place of business such as ambulance services will increase from twenty five dollars ($25)
for the first vehicle to fifty dollars ($50) for the first vehicle and from fifteen dollars ($15)
for each additional vehicle to thirty dollars ($30) for each additional vehicle.

Currently, the maximum business license tax for other businesses which would be affected
by this Measure is thirty dollars ($30) a year. Approval of this Measure would result in a
maximum business license tax of one hundred dollars ($100) a year for those businesses.

The revenue collected from this tax will be deposited into the City's general fund and
may be spent for any municipal purpose.
