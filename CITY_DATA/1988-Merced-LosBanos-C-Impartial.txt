Impartial Analysis, of The City of
Occupancy Tax Measure.

Transient

On July 6, 1988, the Los Banos City Council adopted
Resolution No. 2781, which calls for an increase in the
Transient Occupancy Tax from 6% to 9%. According to law,
and the provisions of Resolution NO. 2781, this increase
cannot go into effect until approved by the voters.

If approved, this measure will require operators of hotels,
motels, etc. to collect a tax from transient occupants at a
rate equal to 9% of the periodic room rate. The measure
will not result in an increase in taxes to the general
population or property owners of the City.

The proceeds from the taxes will be used for general
municipal purposes.
