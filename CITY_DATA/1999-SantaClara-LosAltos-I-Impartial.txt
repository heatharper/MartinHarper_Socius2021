CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE I

This measure, if approved by a majority of the voters voting, will authorize the Los
Altos City Council to set the annual rate of any of its five utility users taxes at any amount
up to 6.25%. Presently, the tax cannot exceed 3.5%, upon water, gas, electricity,
telephone and cable television services. A yes vote would authorize the City Council
to increase the rate by up to 2.75%; a no vote would deny such authorization and the
maximum authorized tax rate would remain at 3.5%. A financial analysis prepared by
the City indicates that if the City Council levies the maximum amount, the increase
would be approximately $8.00 a month for the typical home occupant, although
amounts vary due to size of household, number of appliances, conservation efforts and
other factors.

The tax would be for general revenue and all proceeds would be placed into the
City’s general fund. However, a companion measure appearing just before this one on
the ballot, would request the City Council to spend any increased utility user tax
revenues above the presently authorized rate of 3.5%, for a variety of repairs, capital
improvements and personnel augmentations in recreation, traffic engineering and
control, and emergency communications. Some of these improvements would be
deferred indefinitely without additional revenues.

The tax is set annually by a vote of the City Council. It is collected by the various
utilities at no cost to the City and transmitted directly to it. All revenues raised by the
tax are spent within the city limits of the City of Los Altos for City purposes.

Existing provisions of the law setting an annual cap on the utility users tax and
providing for senior exemptions will continue and will apply to the increase.
