TOWN ATTORNEYâ€™S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF
MEASURE G

TOWN OF ROSS
SPECIAL TAX FOR PARAMEDIC SERVICES

If this measure is approved by a two-thirds vote, the special tax for paramedic services administered by a Joint
Powers Authority, the voters authorized in 1998, 2002 and
2006 will be continued with a tax of $42 (plus fifty cents
County administrative fee) incrementally increasing by $3
if needed, not to exceed $51 per year (plus fifty cents
County administrative fee) per taxable living unit and per

1,500	square feet of developed parcel in non-residential
use in the fourth year, to be collected in addition to fees for
transport to the hospital charged to insurance providers for
Ross Valley residents. The applicable appropriations limit
pursuant to Article XIIIB of the California Constitution
will be increased in an amount equal to the proceeds of the
special tax. The special tax and the corresponding increase
in the appropriation limit expire on June 30, 2015.
