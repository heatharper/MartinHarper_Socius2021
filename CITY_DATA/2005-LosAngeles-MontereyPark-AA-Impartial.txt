IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS
Measure AA- Fire/Police Homeland Protection Act

At its December 1, 2004 meeting, the City
Council decided to submit to the voters Measure AA
which would impose a special fire/police protection levy
on properties in the City of Monterey Park in the amounts
as set forth in the Measure. The special levy can be
used only to pay for (i) capital and financing costs for
improvements to Fire Stations No. 2 and 3, (ii) funding of
current pension program costs, (iii) salary parity for fire
and police personnel, and (iv) increased staffing of 3 fire
and 4 police personnel. Measure AA states that it is the
intent and purpose of this special levy to supplement, not
replace, the City’s current general fund expenditures for
the fire and police departments.

If at least two-thirds of the voters approve Measure
AA, a special annual levy on parcels will be established
and the monies collected shall be deposited in a special
fund to be used by the City only as provided above.
Property owners will pay the levy amounts beginning
with the 2005/2006 property tax year. The City Council
may reduce the levy in any year but cannot increase
the levy greater than as stated in the Measure plus the
consumer price index. The term of this special parcel
levy is twenty-five years. Measure AA exempts property
owners from the fire/police protection levy who (i) are
religious, charitable or community service organizations
which qualify for ad valorem tax exemptions, (ii) are low-
income, or (iii) qualify for the City’s utility user’s life line
program. Further, property owners over the age of 65
years residing in a single-family or condominium unit will
be charged 50% of the special levy amount.
