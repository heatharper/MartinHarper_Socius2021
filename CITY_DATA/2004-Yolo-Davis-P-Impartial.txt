IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY MEASURE P

Measure P, if approved by a majority of the voters voting on the measure, will authorize an additional 1/2 cent sales tax within the City of Davis. This 1/2 cent sales tax would be a "general tax," meaning that the revenue raised from the tax would go into the Cityâ€™s general fund and could be used for any legal governmental purpose. The City would not be bound to use these tax monies for any special purpose or for any particular projects, facilities, or programs.

California Revenue and Taxation Code section 7290 authorizes
the City of Davis to levy a transactions and use tax (sales tax) at
a 0.5 percent (1/2 cent) rate so long as the tax is approved by the
City Council and a majority of the voters voting in an election on
that issue. If approved, the Measure P sales tax would become
effective on July 1, 2004.

This 1/2 cent sales tax would be paid in addition to current sales
taxes. The current sales tax within the City (including state and local
sales taxes) is 7.25 percent. If Measure P is approved by the voters,
the total sales tax would be 7.75 percent. This 1/2 cent sales tax
would be collected at the same time and in the same manner as
existing sales taxes.

The 1/2 cent sales tax would sunset and be repealed on December
31, 2010 and could not be collected after that time unless a majority
of the voters voting in an election approved an extension or re-authorization of the tax.
