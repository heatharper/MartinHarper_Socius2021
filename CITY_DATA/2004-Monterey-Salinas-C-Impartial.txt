IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
BUSINESS LICENSE FEES MEASURE C

This ballot measure, if adopted by a majority of the voters, would
amend Chapter 19 of the Salinas City Code regarding Business
Licenses.

The ballot measure would restore City imposed fees for business
licenses to the levels in effect in 1998. The ballot measure also
removes the exemption from such tax for manufacturers, vegetable-
packing plants, and other businesses.

If this ballot measure is adopted, the due date for annual license
taxes measured by gross receipts would be moved from no later
than the first day of January to no later than the first day of February.
Additionally, all other annual license taxes shall be due and payable
in advance no later than the first day of August of each year.

All revenue generated from the proposed tax increase would be
deposited in the City’s General Fund and, accordingly, all monies
collected pursuant to this amendment would be used by the City to
pay for usual and current City operations and services, including
funding for police, fire, park maintenance, street maintenance, and
recreational facilities and programs. As such, this ballot measure
proposes a “general purpose tax,” rather than a “special purpose
tax," and requires a simple majority vote for adoption.
