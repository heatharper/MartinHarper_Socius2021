MEASURE “E”

ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY

Under Proposition 218 known as the Right to Vote on Taxes Act voter approval for certain
tax levies is required. Proposition 218 was added to the California Constitution as Article
XIIIC. Proposition 218 defines as “special tax” “any tax imposed for specific purposes
including taxes imposed for specific purposes which are placed into a general fund.” Under
Article XIIIC of the California Constitution, general law cities, such as the City of Victorville,
are authorized to impose new or increase existing special taxes, if a proposed new levy or
increase is approved by a two thirds vote of the voters.

The passage of the special tax for public safety, police and fire services within the City of
Victorville by a two thirds vote of the voters in the City would enact Ordinance No. 1877.

The Measure will have a fiscal impact of $2,100,000. This figure represents the original Fire
Benefit Suppression amount of 1.6 million dollars, plus the cost of living increases from 1994
to present. Also included in this figure is the additional $500,000 in various assessments for
street lighting, etc., which were lost under Proposition 218 plus cost of living increases. This
amount would be used for the Police Department. This Ordinance authorizes the City to
assess real property located within the City of Victorville as follows:

Single Family Residence
Multi-family

Commercial & Industrial
Vacant Land

$86.29/year

47.26/year/unit

(not to exceed $9,452 - 100 units)
.052/square foot/year
(not to exceed $10,400 - 200,000 sq. ft.)
17.28/acre/year

(not to exceed $432.00 - 25 acres)

The revenue from the special tax will generate approximately 2.1 million dollars. Under
Proposition 218 the City of Victorville’s legally adopted 1993 Fire Benefit Assessment
became illegal. The financial loss to the City of Victorville for the fiscal year 1997-1998 was
approximately $1,650,000. This Measure will offset in part, the 1,650,000 loss to the City of
Victorville for fire protection services. The proceeds from these taxes will go into a special
fund to be used solely for public safety, police and fire protection services to replace
revenues lost due to the impacts of Proposition 218. This special tax cannot be used to
finance any general municipal services other than police and fire services.

If approved, the Measure will add the necessary authorizing provisions to the Victorville
Municipal Code. In the future, no special tax rate can be changed or increased unless by
a two thirds vote of the voters. The Measure has a sunset clause and will automatically expire
five (5) years from the effective date of adoption by the voters.

A “yes” vote on the Measure is a vote to approve and authorize the City to assess a special
tax for public safety, police and fire services. A “no” vote is a vote against special tax for
public safety, police and fire services.
