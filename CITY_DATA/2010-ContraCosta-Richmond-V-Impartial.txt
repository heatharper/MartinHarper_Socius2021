CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS

Background. The City of Richmond imposes an annual business license tax on each
person conducting a business, trade or profession in the City. For most businesses, the
tax is based on the number of employees of the business. The proceeds of the business
license tax are deposited in the City’s General Fund and may be used for any City
purpose.

In July 2010, the Richmond City Council began considering a proposed ordinance to
allow the sale of marijuana for medical purposes at up to three locations within the City.
If that ordinance is adopted and becomes effective, such sales would be subject to
significant regulation by the City.

Proposition 19 is a statewide measure on the November 2, 2010 ballot. If adopted, the
measure would permit the use, possession, and sale of marijuana for personal, non-
medical purposes throughout California. Under Proposition 19, local governments could
regulate and tax commercial activities related to marijuana.

Under current City law, a marijuana business would pay a business license tax based on
the number of persons employed by the business.

The Measure. Measure V would impose a specific business license tax on any business
conducting commercial activity involving marijuana, including selling, cultivating,
transporting, or storing marijuana. Such businesses would pay an annual tax in the
amount of 5% of the “gross receipts” of the business. “Gross receipts” means the total
amount received by a person for the sale of goods or the performance of any act or
service in connection with a marijuana business. This business license tax would apply
to nonprofit organizations conducting a marijuana business, and is a general tax that will
fund general City services.
