Impartial Analysis from City Attorney 

Measure S submits an ordinance, providing for increased rates for the existing utility
user's tax, to the voters for their approval in compliance with Proposition 218, the

Right to Vote on Taxes Act.

Measure S would increase the current 4% rate to 6% and the current 2% rate to 3%,
effective July 1, 2005. These are maximum rates that cannot be increased without voter
approval. The City Council is required to conduct an annual public hearing to determine
if the rates can be lowered.

Other than the rates, there are no changes to the utility user's tax ordinance.

If Measure S is not approved by the voters, the current rates would continue to be
imposed.

The La Verne utility user's tax is a general tax, and revenues collected are used to pay
for the cost of general city operations, including police protection, fire services, park
maintenance, public street lighting and mobilehome rent control administration.
