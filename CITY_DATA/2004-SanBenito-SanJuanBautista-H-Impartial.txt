IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
MEASURE H

The San Juan Bautista City Council has placed Measure H on the
March 2, 2004 ballot asking voters to adopt an ordinance that would impose a 2% special transient occupancy tax to fund public restroom
and parking improvements in the City.

A transient occupancy tax is a tax on hotel guests staying in hotels
for periods of 30 days or less. The hotel collects the tax from
the guest and remits the tax to the City. Currently, the San Juan
Bautista Municipal Code imposes a transient occupancy tax of 10% of room rental rate. This tax is a general tax, and is deposited into
The City's general fund where it is available to fund general governmental services.

Measure H, if passed by the voters, would adopt an ordinance adding a new section 3-4-207 to the San Juan Bautista Municipal Code imposing a special transient occupancy tax of 2%. The ordinance specifies that the proceeds from this new tax may only be used for the funding of public restroom and parking improvements within the
City, and for no other purpose. If Measure H is adopted by the voters, the total transient occupancy tax imposed on hotel guests
will be 12%.

A "yes" vote is a vote to adopt the ordinance allowing the City to impose a special transient occupancy tax of 2% on hotel guests. A â€œno" vote is a vote against adopting this ordinance.

Measure H requires a "yes" vote of two-thirds of the voters to pass.
