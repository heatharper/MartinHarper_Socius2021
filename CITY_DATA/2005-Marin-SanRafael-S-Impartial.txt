IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
MEASURE S

If approved by the voters, this measure would amend the San Rafael
Municipal Code to establish a retail transactions and use tax within the
City. This measure would set the retail transactions and use tax rate at
one-half of one percent (0.50%) in the City of San Rafael. At this rate,
for example, a transaction amounting to $100 in value would generate a
tax of 50 cents.

The proposed transactions and use tax would be imposed upon the
sale of all tangible personal property sold at retail within the City as well
as on the storage, use or other consumption of tangible personal
property purchased from any retailer within the City. This measure
would authorize the City, as required by law, to contract with the State
Board of Equalization to administer and collect the tax.

This measure requires all proceeds of the tax to be deposited into the
City’s General Fund to be used for all general municipal governmental
purposes in the City’s discretion.

This measure would provide several enumerated exemptions and
exclusions from the transactions and use tax. It would further prohibit
the issuance of any injunction to prohibit the collection of the tax, as well
as provide for a citizens oversight committee to be appointed by the City
Council to review the collection and expenditures of tax revenues
generated by the tax. The measure would provide that the City’s
authority to impose this tax would expire ten years following its operative
date.

The ordinance proposed by this measure will only become effective if
approved by a simple majority of those electors voting on the measure.

A YES vote approves the measure.

A NO vote rejects the measure.
