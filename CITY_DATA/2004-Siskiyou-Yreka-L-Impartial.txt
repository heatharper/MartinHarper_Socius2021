IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
MEASURE L

City of Yreka Increase Of The Transient Occupancy Tax Of The
City Of Yreka Be Submitted To The Voters For Approval And
Fixing Time For Election

The City of Yreka is proposing a General Tax Measure to be
submitted to the voters in the City of Yreka. The proposed tax is
a general tax, for general governmental purposes, and not a special
or ad valorem tax.

The tax requires a majority vote of those voting on the measure.
Revenue raised by the tax would go to the general fund of the City
of Yreka to be used for general governmental purposes. Examples
of general governmental purpose expenditures are local services
such as fire, police, recreation, parks, senior programs, and local
access television, which are services often used by travelers.

The transient occupancy tax of the City of Yreka is contained in
Chapter 3.12 of the Yreka Municipal Code. This tax would apply to
hotels as defined in the Yreka Municipal Code. The tax would be
collected, as provided in the Yreka Municipal Code, from persons
occupying hotels for 30 consecutive days or less. The cities of
Weed, Mt. Shasta and Dunsmuir have transient occupancy tax rates
of ten percent (10%). The current tax of the City of Yreka is eight
percent (8%) of the rent charged by the operator. This measure
would increase the tax by two percent (2%).

If the proposed general tax receives the approval of a majority
of the voters voting on the measure, the tax would become effective
on the date the City Council certifies the results of the election.
The proposed general tax is not limited to any time period. If approved
by a majority of the voters voting on the measure, the tax would
remain in effect until later amended.

A â€œYes" vote favors passage of this general tax, while a "No"
vote is against passage of this general tax.
