FOR MEASURE L 2006

Solvang has previously enacted a Transient Occupancy Tax. That
tax is found in Section 3-2-2 of the Solvang Municipal Code and
Improvised that a general tax equal to 10% of rent shall be charged for a
room rent of 30 days or less. For example, if a hotel room costs $125.00
per night the Transient Occupancy Tax is $12.50,

This measure would change the existing law by changing the
general tax from 10% to 9%, and imposing a special tax of 2% which
would be segregated in a "Conference and Visitors Promotion Fund" to be
used to promote tourism only in the City of Solvang. For example, if a
hotel room costs $125.00 the total Transient Occupancy Tax would
become $13.75 and of that, $2.50 would go into the Conference and
Visitors Promotion Fund and $11.25 would go Into the General Fund. This
brings in an additional 1% and changes 1% of what used to be a general
tax into a special tax.

Under this measure, the City would be allowed to contract annually
with a non-profit corporation established to promote tourism In the City of
Solvang and the Santa Ynez Valley. The contract obligation would
depend on satisfactory performance of approved goals.

Under this measure, any contracting non-profit agency would be
required to prepare and submit an annual accounting of all expenditures
made with the Conference and Visitors Promotion Fund monies, and also
make its books and records available for review by the City's
Administrative Services Director for examination or audit upon reasonable
notice. Any contracting non-profit agency would also be required to
provide annual reports demonstrating achievement of goals related to
tourism in the City of Solvang.

In order to be adopted the measure must be approved by two-thirds
of the voters voting on it.
