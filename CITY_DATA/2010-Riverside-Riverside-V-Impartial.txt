IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE “V”

(Transient Occupancy Tax-Amendment to RMC 5,32)

This Measure contains a proposed amendment to Chapter 5.32 of the
Riverside Municipal Code with respect to the City’s transient occupancy
tax. This tax is only charged to persons staying at hotels and motels
within the City. The proposed amendment would increase the transient
occupancy tax from its current rate of 11% of the room charge to 12% of
the room charge, beginning duly 1, 2012, and from 12% to 13%,
beginning July 1,2014.

The City’s transient occupancy tax rate has remained at 11 % since 1993. It
is paid only by those persons staying at hotels and motels within the City
for thirty days or less and is not paid by property owners within the City.

Revenues from the transient occupancy tax are collected by the hotel
and motel operators from their guests and then paid over to the City. The
revenues are not designated for any particular purpose and are placed
into the City’s general fund and used for various general city purposes,
including police and fire protection, youth and senior programs, streets,
parks, tourism promotion, libraries, the convention center and the
museum.

This Measure, if approved by a majority of the voters, would not increase
the transient occupancy tax rate from its current 11% until July 1,2012,
when the tax rate would increase by 1% to 12%. It would then remain at
12% until July 1, 2014, when it would increase from 12% to 13%. The
measure also enables the City to adjust the tax to any rate that is less that
12% after July 1,2012, and to any rate that is less that 13% at any time
after July 1,2014, and to repeal the tax without further voter approval.

Further, if approved by a majority of the voters, the Measure would
prohibit any increase in the current rate of the transient occupancy tax
prior to July 1, 2012, and would prohibit any increase of the rate above
12% percent prior to July 1.2014, It would also prohibit any increase in
the rate above 13% after July 1,2014.

This Impartial Analysis is hereby submitted to the Elections Official in
conformance with Section 9280 of the Elections Code of the State of
California.
