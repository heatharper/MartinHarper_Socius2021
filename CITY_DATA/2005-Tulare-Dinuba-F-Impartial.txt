IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
MEASURE F

Measure F proposes to raise revenue for police and fire protection by authorizing a 3/4 cent sales tax within the City of Dinuba. The tax would be paid in addition to current State and local sales taxes and would be collected at the same time and in the same manner as the existing sales
taxes.

California Revenue and Taxation Code Section 7285.91 authorizes the City Council to levy a
transactions and use tax (i.e. a "sales") tax for a special purpose (i.e., fire and police protection)
at certain rates, including a 0.75 percent (i.e., a 3/4 cent) rate if all of the following requirements
are met: (a) The ordinance proposing that tax is approved by a two-thirds vote of all members of
the governing body and is subsequently approved by a two-thirds vote of the qualified voters of
the city voting in an election on the issue, (b) The transactions and use tax conforms to the
Transactions and Use Tax Law Part 1.6 (commencing with Section 7251). (c) The ordinance
includes an expenditure plan describing the specific projects for which the revenues from the tax
may be expended.

Measure F states that the 3/4 cent sales tax would be used for "to hire, train and retain
police/firefighters/paramedics/9-1-1 dispatchers; expand neighborhood/school policing and
crime prevention efforts including more after-school, anti-gang and anti-drug programs; upgrade
the 9-1-1 Emergency Response Center; and purchase fire engines/ambulances." The City is
legally bound to use the funds for police and fire protection and there is a proposed ten-year
Expenditure Plan.

The Measure provides for a citizens oversight committee, independent annual audits and a ten-year review of the use of the funds.
