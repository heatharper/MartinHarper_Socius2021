If approved by two-thirds (2/3) of the qualified electors of the City, the
passage of Measure "MM" will enact Ordinance No. 1038. This Ordinance will authorize the City to levy a special tax on all parcels of real
property within the City in order to fund police protection services in the
City. This special tax will in part replace police service special taxes
levied, if any, as part of Community Facilities District No. 1, Community
Facilities District No. 2 and Community Facilities District No. 3, which are
currently levied at approximately $117 per year per single family residence. So long as this special tax is levied, no special taxes for police
protection services will be levied by Community Facilities District No. 1,
Community Facilities District No. 2 and Community Facilities District No.

3.The special tax revenues will be placed in a legally restricted fund to be used solely for police protection services.  The special tax will be levied as follows:	
A. Commercial/Industriai Parcels	$375 Per acre
B. Multiple Family Residential Parcels	$85 Per dwelling
(2 or more dwelling units)	unit
C. Single Family Residential Parcels	$85  Per dwelling unit
D. Vacant Land/Agricultural parcels	$10 Per acres Special tax applies only to the first 10 acres of each parcel.

Senior Citizen Development

(Head of household, 55 years or older) 75% of applicable

Multiple Family or
Single Family
Residential Parcel
special tax rate

The special tax will be subject to no automatic increases.

Because the proposed measure authorizes the levying of a new special
tax, it requires the approval of two-thirds of the Cityâ€™s voters voting in the
election.
