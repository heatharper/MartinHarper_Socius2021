IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE 0
CITY ATTORNEY

This ballot measure, if adopted by the voters, would enact a one-half of one
percent (1/2%) increase to the sales tax rate in the City of Eureka.

This tax would be a general purpose tax, and all revenue generated from the
proposed sales tax increase would be deposited into the City’s General Fund
and, accordingly, all monies collected pursuant to the sales tax increase would be
used by the City to pay for general City operations and programs including police
protection, fire suppression, emergency medical response, street maintenance,
environmental programs, parks and recreation, and zoo operations. As such, this
ballot measure proposes a “general purpose tax,” rather than a “special purpose
tax,” and requires a simple majority vote for adoption.

The Vz% sales tax would be levied in addition to the current sales tax and would
be collected at the same time and in the same manner as the existing sales tax.
Currently, the sales tax in Eureka is 8.5%. A yes vote would increase the sales
tax rate in the City of Eureka from 8.5% to 9%. The increased tax is estimated to
generate approximately $3.2 million per year.

Measure 0 contains fiscal accountability provisions, which include the creation
by the City Council of a citizen’s oversight committee to annually review the City’s
expenditure of the revenues generated by the tax. The composition of the oversight
committee and its specific duties would be established by the City Council.

If approved by a majority of the voters at the November 1,2010 election, the Vz%
sales tax would become operative on April 1,2011 and would terminate after 5
years.
