Under Article of the California Constitution, general law cities, such as the
City of Azusa, are authorized to impose new or increase existing general taxes,
if a proposed new levy or increase is approved by a majority of the voters.

The passage of Measure G by a majority of voters in the City would enact
Ordinance No. 97-011. This ordinance authorizes the City to increase the existing
general tax on rock, sand and gravel extraction operations conducted in the City.
If approved, the Ordinance will authorize the City Council to levy an extraction
tax in an amount up to $0.35 per ton of extracted rock.

The revenue from the increases in the rock, sand and gravel extraction tax will
generate approximately $950,000, if levied at the maximum amount. This measure
increases an existing tax and does not establish a new tax. The proceeds from this
tax will go into the City’s General Fund to replace revenues lost due to the impacts
of Proposition 218. The general tax revenue can be used to finance all types of
general municipal services, including, but not limited to, parks and recreation,
library, senior citizen program, building, planning, public works and emergency
and safety services.

If approved, the measure will add the necessary authorizing provisions to the
Azusa Municipal Code. In the future, the tax rates can only be changed or
increased beyond the $0.35 plus annual CPI by a majority vote of the voters.
However, the measure will authorize the City Council to implement any necessary
procedures for collection of the tax.

A “yes” vote is a vote to approve and authorize an increase in the rock, sand and
gravel tax. A “no” vote is a vote against an increase in the tax on rock, sand and
gravel businesses.
