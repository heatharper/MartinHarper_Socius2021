IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
CITY OF FORTUNA
MEASURE G

Measure G asks the voters whether the City of Fortuna should
be allowed to raise the maximum tax rate for the transient
occupancy tax (bed tax for motels and RV parks) from the existing
eight (8%) percent to a maximum of ten (10%) percent. The tax is
based upon the nightly rental cost of the motel room or RV space,
and is paid by the guest.

If adopted, the actual tax rate as set forth in Fortuna Municipal
Code Section 3.12.030, or its successor would be established from
time-to-time by the City Council, and could fluctuate, but never
exceed ten (10%) percent.

The transient occupancy tax is a general tax and all revenue
generated by the tax would go to provide essential governmental
services. It is estimated that the tax presently generates $179,000
annually, and that the tax would generate an additional $21,000
for each one (1%) percent it is increased.

The measure must be approved by a majority of the voters.
