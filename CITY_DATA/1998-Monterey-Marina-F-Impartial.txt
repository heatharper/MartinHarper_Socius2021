IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
CITY OF MARINA
MEASURE F

EXTENSION OF

THE UTILITY USER’S TAX, WITH ADDITIONAL LIMITATIONS

City of Marina Ballot Measure "F" presents to the electors the
question of whether the City’s five percent (5%) Utility User’s Tax,
with additional conditions, shall be extended for a limited period
expiring June 30, 2004.

In both 1994 and 1996 the citizens of the City of Marina voted
to approve two-year extensions of the five percent (5%) tax on
the use of utilities and cable television within the city. The City
Council has now unanimously voted to place the matter of the
tax’s extension before the electorate at this time, but with the
following new restrictions on or conditions of the proposed tax: a)
the tax is not automatically set at 5%, but can only be to 5%
(and so can be less than 5%), as specifically set by the City
Council; b) the Council’s action can only be by a 4/5ths vote; c)
after two noticed public hearings; d) upon making specific findings
of a need for the funds for essential city services; e) by
ordinances effective for only 2-years each; and f) in any event
expiring on June 30, 2004.

A "Yes" vote on this ballot measure is a vote in favor of the City
Council’s proposal to extend the existing Utility User’s Tax, as
restricted, for a period expiring June 30, 2004.

A "No" vote is a vote against the extension of the existing Utility
User’s Tax, as restricted.
