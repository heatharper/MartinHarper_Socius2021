IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY CITY OF TEHACHAPI MEASURE D	

The Transient Occupancy Tax was first imposed in the City of Tehachapi in 1970. It is a tax imposed on persons staying in a hotel or motel (or other commercial rooming house) and is charged and collected by the hotel or motel owner.  

On June 19,1995, the City Council raised the tax from 8% to 10% and ever since that time, the hotels and motels within the City have been charging the tax. On November 5,1996, the California Electorate approved Proposition 218 which provided in part that all taxes imposed after January 1,1995 without voter approval would have to obtain voter approval on or before the general election of 1998 or terminate. The City Council has therefore placed this matter on the ballot for voter approval. Money collected from the Transient Occupancy Tax goes into the Cityâ€™s general fund for use in providing general city services.
