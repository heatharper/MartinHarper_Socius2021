IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF PROPOSITION F

By Michael Jenkins, City Attorney

Proposition F is a proposal to approve an ordinance that would levy a special tax,
commencing with fiscal year 1996-97, to provide funds for crossing guard services
within the City. The special tax is projected to raise approximately $96,000 in fiscal year 1996-97 to be used exclusively for school crossing guards.

The tax would be levied annually against all taxable real property in the City, commencing with the December 1996 property tax bill. The amount of the tax
would not exceed the following (subject to automatic annual increases in accordance with increases in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers for the Los Angeles-Orange-Riverside metropolitan area):

Residential parcels:

$9.00 per dwelling unit

Non-residential parcels:

$9.00 per each 1/8 acre of lot area, or portion thereof, up to a maximum of $81.00 per parcel

As the City is no longer imposing property assessments to fund school crossing guards, the special tax proposed by this measure, if approved, would be the only source of restricted funds for these services.

The tax would be collected on the County of Los Angeles property tax roll, along with other taxes collected by the County of Los Angeles.

A “yes” vote is in favor of adoption of the special crossing guard tax; a “no” vote
is against adoption of the tax. A two-thirds “yes” vote of those voting on
Proposition F is required for its passage.
