CITY ATTORNEY'S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE G

This advisory measure, if approved by a majority of the voters, will result in the City Council adopting an ordinance enacting a three and one-half percent (3.5%) Utility User Tax. The measure would prohibit a Utility User Tax increase without another vote of the people. Low income individuals and senior citizens, age 62 or older, will not have to pay the Utility User Tax for their home within the City. The Utility User Tax would have a cap on the amount paid by businesses. The tax would automatically expire in 6 1/2 years on June 30, 2001, unless reauthorized by the
voters before that date.

Morgan Hill currently does not have a Utility User Tax. The tax would only apply to
residents' gas. electric, cable television, and phone bills. No tax would be charged for sewer, water, or garbage.

The Finance Department calculates that the tax would generate approximately 
$875,000 of annual revenue. The Utility User Tax money would be deposited into
the City's General Fund, Excluding the unallocated contingency and that portion of
general government services supported by other operating funds, public safety
services represent more than 87% of general fund expenditures. The remainder
consists of a grant to the Senior Center, parks maintenance, operation of our cable
television channel, and a portion of general government services. 

A "yes" vote on the ballot measure will result in the adoption of the utility User tax, as described. A “no” vote will mean that the Utility User Tax will not be imposed.
