IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY MEASURE H98

Measure H98 asks voters to decide if the City of Arroyo Grande should
increase the Transient Occupancy Tax rate from 6% to 10%. The Transient
Occupancy Tax is a tax charged to people who stay in motels, hotels
and inns for thirty (30) days or less. City of Arroyo Grande Ordinance
No. 455 decreased the Transient Occupancy Tax rate from 10% to 6%
of the rent charged. The reduction in the Transient Occupancy Tax rate
from 10% to 6% resulted in an average annual loss in revenue of
approximately $90,000 to $110,000. The revenue from the Transient
Occupancy Tax is used to fund fire and police services as well as all
other general city functions.
