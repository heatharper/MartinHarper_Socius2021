<impartial> TOWN ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF
MEASURE K

California Revenue and Taxation Code section 7285.9
authorizes the Town Council of the Town of Moraga to levy a General
Transactions and Use Tax (i.e. sales tax) if the ordinance proposing the
tax is approved by a two-thirds vote of all members of the Town Council
and the tax is approved by a majority vote of the Town's voters. The
Town Council has approved the ordinance as required and submitted it
to the voters.

Measure K would enact a one percent (1.00%) increase to the
sales tax rate on certain purchases made in the Town of Moraga. The
proposed tax would be in addition to existing sales taxes and would be
collected at the same time and in the same manner as other sales taxes.
The measure would continue for a period of twenty (20) years from the
date of commencement. Any extension to the duration of the proposed
tax beyond twenty (20) years would require action by the Town Council
and a new vote of the people. The measure requires a majority vote (i.e.
50 percent plus one) to pass.

Measure K is considered a general tax under state law. As a
result, if adopted, the revenues received from the tax would be placed in
the Town's general fund and could be used in any manner authorized by
law and as directed by the Town Council. Accordingly, the monies
collected could be used by the Town to pay for Town services and
programs such as road repair and maintenance, police services and
recreation programs.

A “Yes” vote on Measure K would increase the sales tax rate in
the Town of Moraga from the current eight and one-quarter percent
(8.25%) to nine and one-quarter percent (9.25%) for a period of twenty
(20) years. A “No” vote on Measure K would leave the sales tax rate in
the Town of Moraga at its current rate of eight and one-quarter percent
(8.25%). <impartialend>
