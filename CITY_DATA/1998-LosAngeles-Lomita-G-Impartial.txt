CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE G

AN ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF LOMITA VALIDATING AND RE-
ENACTING CERTAIN AMENDMENTS TO THE CITY’S BUSINESS
LICENSE TAX

Ordinance No. 600, if adopted, would validate, approve and readopt Ordinance
Nos. 492, 542 and 553. Ordinance No. 600 would, therefore, effect no change to
existing law, as adopted by Ordinance Nos. 492, 542 and 553.

Ordinance No. 492, adopted on December 2, 1991, provides for, among other
things, an application for business licenses and the computation of the license fee
relating thereto; penalties for failure to comply with the provisions of the business
license law; and an increase in the amount of the business license fee for
businesses, professions and trades generally and with respect to specific categories
of businesses. Ordinance No. 492 also imposes individual liability for the payment
of the business license fees and provides for annual indexing of the fees based
on the consumer price index (CPI).

Ordinance No. 542 was adopted on May 1, 1995 and deleted the exemption for
public utilities and franchise holders from compliance with the business license
law, thereby imposing a business license fee upon such enterprises.

Ordinance No. 553 was adopted on September 18,1995 and increased the amount
of the business license fees for businesses, professions and trades generally and

with respect to specific categories of businesses.

Ordinance No. 600, if adopted, would also provide that the City Council may
repeal or amend Ordinance Nos. 492, 542 and 553 without a vote of the people,
provided, however, that any amendment which increases the amount or rate of
tax beyond the levels authorized by those ordinances must be approved by a vote
of the people pursuant to Propositions 62 and 218.
