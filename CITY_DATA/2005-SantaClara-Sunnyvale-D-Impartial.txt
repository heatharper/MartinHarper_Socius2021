Impartial Analysis from County Counsel
California law permits a city to increase a general tax within its jurisdiction if the tax increase is approved by a simple majority of the voters voting in an election.
The business license tax applies to a business operating in the City of Sunnyvale. The City of Sunnyvale's current business license tax for a business in the City of Sunnyvale is $10 for every 5 employees or rental units and is capped at $300. The current tax was established in 1968 and has not been increased since that date. The City of Sunnyvale proposes to increase its existing business license tax from $10 for every 5 employees or rental units to $30 for 1, $50 for 2 to 5, and $50 for each additional group of up to 5 employees or rental units, whichever is greater. The maximum business license tax will be capped at $4,250 for rental units and $9,500 for employees with the tax phased in over a two year period and the cap phased in over a three year period.
The 2007 tax is $20 for the first employee, $30 for 2 to 5 employees or rental units, and an additional $25 for each additional group of up to 5 employees or rental units. The 2007 cap is $4,700 for employees and $2,500 for rental units. The 2008 tax is $30 for the first employee, $50 for 2 to 5 employees or rental units, and $50 for each additional group of up to 5 employees or rental units. The 2008 cap is $7,000 for employees and $3,500 for rental units. The 2009 tax is the same as 2008, with the cap raised to $9,500 for employees and $4,250 for rental units. After 2009 for the tax and 2010 for the cap, these will be adjusted annually based on the consumer price index increase for the period 2 years prior to the tax year.
The proceeds of the business license tax , as a general tax, will be deposited in the city's general fund and used for general governmental purposes, including police and fire protection services, library, and parks services.
A "yes" vote is a vote to increase the City of Sunnyvale business license tax to $30 for 1, $50 for 2 to 5, and $50 for each additional group of up to 5 employees or rental units, with the maximum business license tax capped at $4,250 for rental units and $9,500 for employees and with the tax increase phased in over a two year period and cap increase phased in over a three year period.
A "no" vote is a vote not to increase the business license tax from its current rate of $10 for every 5 employees or rental units.
