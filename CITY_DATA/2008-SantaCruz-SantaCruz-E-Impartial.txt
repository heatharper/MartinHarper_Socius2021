IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
BALLOT MEASURE E

PROPOSED CITY OF SANTA CRUZ CLEAN RIVER, BEACHES AND
OCEAN TAX

This ballot measure, if adopted by the voters, would result in the imposition of a
special parcel tax on each parcel of property in the City of Santa Cruz. The tax
would not be imposed upon parcel owners who are exempt from local taxation by
virtue of the United States or California Constitution. The tax proceeds would be
deposited into a special segregated “Clean River, Beaches and Ocean Parcel Tax
Fund” to be maintained and administered by the City. Tax proceeds would be used
exclusively for the purposes of: reducing and preventing water pollution and man-
aging stormwater runoff, including but not limited to, improved management practices for protection of watersheds and water quality; maintenance, capital
improvements, environmental restoration and upgrades to stormwater collection,
conveyance, management and treatment systems; implementation of stormwater
best management practices; public education and outreach activities intended to
prevent or reduce water pollution; compliance with local, state and federal storm-
water regulations; and underwriting costs associated with the administration,
enforcement and amendment of the subject tax ordinance.

The ballot measure proposes the following annual parcel taxation rates:

•	parcels developed with a single family dwelling: $28 per year

•	parcels developed for uses other than single family dwelling: $94 per year

•	vacant parcels/park parcels: $10 per year

The tax would be levied so long as tax revenue is necessary to pay for any financing of capital improvements undertaken to obtain the objectives for which the tax is
levied or as long as tax revenue is necessary to underwrite any services under-
taken for which the tax is levied.

The tax ordinance would require the City Council to designate a citizens’ oversight
committee to review the ongoing use of tax proceeds, would require the City’s Fi-
nance Director to file annual reports with the City Council summarizing the amount
of tax proceeds collected and expended as well as the status of any projects
funded with tax proceeds, and would require an annual audit by an independent
public accounting firm to assure the proper disbursement of tax proceeds in accordance with the objectives and purposes of the tax ordinance.

The City Council is proposing the tax on the basis of its finding, among others, that
the reduction of pollution, trash, toxics and dangerous bacteria in our streams,
river, bay, ocean and on our beaches is necessary to protect public health and
safety, to protect fish and wildlife habitat, to protect the environment, and to protect
the quality of life and economic vitality of the city.

This ballot measure proposes a “special purposes tax” rather than a “general tax”
and therefore requires a two-thirds (2/3) majority for adoption.
