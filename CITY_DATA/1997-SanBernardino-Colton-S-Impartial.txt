MEASURE “S”

ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY*

Ordinance No. 0-1-98, if approved by the voters, will impose a graduated special utility
users tax within the City. The initial tax will be at the rate of 1.643 per cent (1.643%) from
May 1, 1997 until April 30, 1998. Beginning May 1, 1998 and continuing until April 30, 2005,
the tax rate will be 1.933 per cent (1.933%). The special tax will only take effect after the City’s
current utility users tax, which is assessed at the rate of six per cent (6%) on utility users,
expires in April of 1998. If approved by the voters, the special tax will replace the current utility
users tax at a reduced tax rate.

The proceeds of this special tax must be used to fund salary increases for police and fire
safety personnel. Those salary increases include a four per center (4%) increase that is
expected to be in place by May 1, 1997; an additional three per cent (3%) increase for fiscal
year 1998-99; and an additional three per cent (3%) increase for fiscal year 1999-2000 unless
extended by action of the City Council. The special tax will continue to cover only these
increases in salary until April 30, 2005 or to any extended termination date of the special tax
regardless of whether any additional increases may be authorized by the City Council.

The special tax will be imposed on the use of telephone, cable television, electric and
natural gas services, co-generated electricity, water and wastewater services, refuse hauling
services and direct purchases of gas or electricity and will be paid by the utility users. The
maximum tax any major commercial or industrial user will pay is $20,000 per year. The
special tax will be remitted to the utility provider, which in turn will make periodic
disbursement to the City.

No exemptions from the special tax are included in the measure, but the City Council has
the authority under the measure to allow exemptions and in the past, an exemption for very
low income families has been authorized for previous utility users taxes.

The special tax may be repealed, reduced or extended by action of the City Council. This
means that the special tax may remain in existence beyond 2005 without a new vote of the
electorate, but it may only be used for funding the increases in public safety personnel
salaries that are scheduled for approval in fiscal years 1997-98, 1998-99 and 1999-2000.

Ordinance No. 0-1-98 will become effective upon a “yes” vote of two-thirds (66.6%) of the
eligible voters of the City of Colton casting votes in this election.
