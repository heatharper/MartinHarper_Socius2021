CITY ATTORNEY'S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE G

Measure G, if approved by a majority vote, would authorize the
collection of a utility users tax in the City of Morgan Hill. The tax would be a general tax Imposed at the rate of two percent (2.0%) on the use of gas, electric, water, sewer, garbage, telecommunications and
video/CATV services.

All revenue generated by the general tax would go to the City's general
fund to provide general city services including, police, emergency
preparedness, libraries, youth and senior services. It is estimated that
the tax will generate approximately $1.6 million per year, which
represents approximately 6% of the City's general operating budget.

Exemptions to the tax are expressly provided, Low income electricity
and gas users who qualify for the California Alternate Rates for Energy
(CARE) Program pursuant to the California Public Utilities Code are
exempt from the tax on gas and electricity usage. The tax would not be
levied against entities exempt by law, including federal and state
agencies and public schools.

The tax would be computed on the basis of monthly usage and service
charges, and would be collected by the utility service provider.

The levy of the utility users tax is subject to review by the City Council
not later than June 30, 2011, and every two years thereafter. If the
Council fails to make findings by a two thirds (2/3) vote that such tax is
necessary-for the financial health of the City, the levy of the tax will
terminate on December 31s1 of the year in which the Council fails to
make the required findings.

A "Yes" vote means the voter is in favor of authorizing the City to.collect
a utility users tax. A "No" vote means the voter Is not in favor of the City collecting a utility users tax.

In order for the City to collect a utility users tax, the ballot measure must
be approved by a majority of the voters voting on the measure.
