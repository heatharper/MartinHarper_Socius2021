IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
CITY OF SCOTTS VALLEY MEASURE E

Measure E seeks voter approval of a utility users tax measure. A
“yes” vote on Measure E will repeal the existing utility tax in the City
of Scotts Valley and replace it with a new utility users tax of five
percent (5%) which is applicable, with some exceptions, to all
charges made to users of gas, electric and telephone services in
Scotts Valley. A “no" vote on Measure E will reject the new utility
users tax and have no affect on the existing utility users tax.
