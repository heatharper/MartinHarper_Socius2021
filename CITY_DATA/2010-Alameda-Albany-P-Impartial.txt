Impartial Analysis from City Attorney
A "Yes" vote would approve the proposed Measure, allowing an annual adjustment commencing in fiscal year 2011-2012 in accordance with the Consumer Price Index for the greater San Francisco area to the Paramedic Advanced Life Support Fire Engines and Ambulance Special Tax.
A "No" vote would reject the proposed measure allowing for an annual adjustment to the Paramedic Advanced Life Support Fire Engines and Ambulance Special Tax.
This is a special tax to fund the Paramedic Advanced Life Support Fire Engines and Ambulance. The California Constitution requires a 2/3 approval of the voters voting.
Background  In 2000, the voters approved a special tax to support the costs of a program for advanced life support for fire engines, ambulances, and credentialed employees. The tax is imposed as a parcel tax. The average residential parcel pays $18.00 per year. At the time this tax was approved, the ordinance did not contain a provision for adjusting this amount to reflect cost of living increases. The tax has not been adjusted since its inception.
Proposed Modification  If approved, commencing fiscal year 2011-2012, the City Council could increase the base tax by the increase in the CPI each year.
Fiscal Impact  The base rate of the present tax for a single family residential property is $18.00 per year. If this Measure is approved, the base rate would be adjusted by the percentage increase in the CPI. If there was a 1% increase in the CPI, the tax base rate would be adjusted to $18.18. In subsequent years the base rate would continue to be adjusted according to the percentage increase in the CPI.
The base rate for commercial property is $200.00 per year. If this Measure is approved, the base rate would be adjusted by the percentage increase in the CPI. If there was a 1% increase in the CPI, the tax base rate would be adjusted to $202.00. In subsequent year the base rate increase in the CPI.
