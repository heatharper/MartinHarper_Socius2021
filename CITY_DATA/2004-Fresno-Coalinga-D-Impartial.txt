IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY

If approved by a majority of the voters at the March 2, 2004 election, Ballot Measure
“D" will allow a Utility Users Tax to become effective. The Utility Users Tax was contained in
Ordinance No. 685 approved by the Coalinga City Council on December 1,2003, however, is not
effective until approved by a majority of the voters at the March 2, 2004 election.

The Utility Users Tax contained in Ballot Measure “D” is a tax in the amount of eight
percent (8%) and will be charged and applied to all telephone charges and electricity charges for
all users of telephone services and all consumers of electricity within the City limits of the City of
Coalinga. It will be charged and collected by the provider of the service. The telephone
company used by a consumer will charge and collect the telephone portion of the tax and Pacific
Gas and Electric Company (PG & E) will charge and collect the electric portion of the tax. The
new Utility Users Tax will be collected and then remitted to the City of Coalinga for use by the
City of Coalinga for general governmental purposes. The Utility Users Tax will expire
automatically after a period of 10 years, and may not be renewed or extended without additional
voter approval at that time. In Ordinance No. 685, approving the Utility Users Tax, the City
Council found and determined that the proceeds of the Utility Users Tax will be essential to
maintain continuing City services.
