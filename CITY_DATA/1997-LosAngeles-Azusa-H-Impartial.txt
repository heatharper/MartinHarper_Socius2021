Under Article XIIIC of the California Constitution, general law cities, such as the
City of Azusa, are authorized to impose new or increase existing general taxes,
if a proposed new levy' or increase is approved by a majority of the voters.

The passage of Measure H by a majority of voters in the City would enact
Ordinance No. 97-012. This ordinance authorizes the City to levy an additional
3% utility users tax on all users of telephone, electric, water and natural gas
services. The tax will, be collected on the utility provider’s utility bills and will be payable by the utility users. The taxes collected by the utility providers will then
be remitted to the City.

The revenue from the utility users tax will generate approximately $840,000. This
measure will authorize an increase in an existing tax and does not establish a new
tax. The existing rules and regulations concerning the collection of the tax and
exemptions from the payment of the utility users tax will still apply. The proceeds
from these taxes will go into the City’s General Fund to replace revenues lost due
to the impacts of Proposition 218. The general tax revenue can be used to finance
all types of general municipal services, including, but not limited to, parks and
recreation, library, senior citizen program, building, planning, public works and
emergency and safety services.

If approved, the measure will add the necessary authorizing provisions to the
Azusa Municipal Code. In the future, the tax rates can only be changed or
increased by a majority vote of the voters. However, the measure will authorize
the City Council to implement any neccessary procedures for collection of the
taxes.

A “yes” vote will authorize the City to levy an additional 3% utility user tax. A
“no” vote is a vote against an increase in the tax.
