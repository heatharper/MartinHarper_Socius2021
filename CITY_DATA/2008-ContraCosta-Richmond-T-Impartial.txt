CITY ATTORNEYâ€™S OFFICE
IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE T

The City of Richmond currently requires businesses in the City to obtain a business
license and pay a business license fee, which is a tax for general revenues. The amount of
this tax is primarily based on the number of persons employed by the business.

Under this measure, manufacturing businesses would be taxed under a new formula.
Manufacturing businesses would pay the greater of (1) the tax that would be paid by
other general businesses or (2) a flat fee of one fourth of one percent (0.250%) of the
value of the raw materials used in the manufacturing process. Only raw materials
actually used in the manufacturing process are counted for purposes of calculating the
tax. Any materials merely owned, stored in inventory, warehoused or transported are not
included in the calculation. The calculation for each tax year would be based on the total
value of materials used in the prior year. The measure contains definitions of
manufacturing, manufacturing materials and a method of valuation in order to implement
this new approach.

This measure, if approved, would result in a uniform business license term. Currently
business licenses run a 12 month period from the date the license is issued. This measure
would set the term for all business licenses to January 1 through December 31 and
provides a mechanism for conforming current business licenses to the new term.

In addition, the measure provides that that the business license fee is not a property tax,
and requires annual audits of the taxes collected under the Richmond Municipal by the
Audit Committee of the Richmond City Council.

The City estimates this Measure will generate about $26,462,500 in new revenue
beginning in 2009, of which about $26,462,500 will come from manufacturing
businesses.
