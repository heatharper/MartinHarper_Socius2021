IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
MEASURE I

A vote for this measure approves the continuation of an existing six percent (6%) tax on
cellular and out-of-state long distance telephone calls. This tax has been charged in
Watsonville since September, 1995. No new tax is created by this measure. If approved, the tax
will remain in effect until December 31, 2002 when it will automatically expire.

California voters approved Proposition 218 in November, 1996. Proposition 218 changed
Article 13 of the California Constitution. This Constitutional change requires that taxes
imposed since January, 1995 be approved by a majority of the voters where the tax is imposed.
If not approved, the tax must end.

This type of tax is often referred to as a "utility user tax". The County of Santa Cruz, all
cities in Santa Cruz County except Capitola, and many other municipalities and counties
across California charge utility user taxes similar to this one.

The tax on out-of-state long distance and cellular telephone bills was imposed by City of
Watsonville Ordinance 972-95 adopted by the Watsonville City Council on June 27, 1995.
Ordinance 972-95 did not create a utility user tax on telephone bills in Watsonville, it only
applied the existing tax to cellular and out-of-state long distance telephone charges. Until
Ordinance 972-95 was adopted, there was a tax on telephone land line, but not cellular
telephone charges. Similarly, until Ordinance 972-95 was adopted, in-state but not out-of-state
long distance telephone charges were taxed.

Because it was imposed after January, 1995, Proposition 218 requires that the tax
imposed by Ordinance 972-95 be approved by the voters of the City of Watsonville on or before
November, 1998. If not approved, this tax on cellular and out-of-state long distance telephone
charges will end. Although Ordinance 972-95 had no sunset provision, the proposal you will
vote on has a sunset clause which automatically terminates the tax on December 31, 2002.

This tax on cellular and out-of-state long distance telephone charges generates about
$250,000 per year for the City. The tax is imposed on both business and residential telephone
usage. There are about 30,000 households in the City of Watsonville. This means the tax
averages less than $8.00 per household per year or less than $0.69 per household per month.
Of course, the higher the cellular and out-of-state long distance charges, the higher the tax will
be. Because a portion of the $250,000 is paid by business users, it is reasonable to assume the
average tax per household is less than $8.00 per year.

All of the $250,000 is used in Watsonville. Of that $250,000, $164,000 or sixty-five
percent (65%) is used for construction and repair of streets and alleys in the City of
Watsonville. The remaining $86,000 goes into the City's General Fund account. Over half of the
General Fund account is used to pay for police and fire protection. The remainder is used for
general City expenses and operations.
