IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
HOLTVILLE UTILITY USER’S TAX
MEASURE S

Holtville Utility User’s Tax was adopted by the City Council in 1991
(Ordinance No. 415), and amended in 1993 (Ordinance No. 422). In
1996, the question of the continued existence of the Utility User’s
Tax was submitted to the voters in Holtville by the City Council. At
that election, a majority of voters cast ballots in favor of the continued
existence of the tax. The Utility User’s Tax is a general tax devoted
for general governmental purposes including police, emergency
services, administration, and parks and recreation. For the fiscal year
1998-1999, anticipated general fund revenue from the tax will
approximate the sum of $317,470.00, or almost 29% of the general
fund budget. By resolution of the Council, there is a cap on the
amount of revenue that the City may collect from the Utility Tax in
any fiscal year.

Proponents of Measure S seek to amend Holtville’s Utility User’s
Tax Ordinance to provide that the rate of tax shall eventually be
eliminated. If adopted, Measure S requires that the rate of tax shall
be reduced from 5% to 3% for the fiscal year commencing July 1,
1997; from 3% to 1% for the fiscal year commencing July 1, 1998;
and for the complete repeal of the entire Utility Use Tax Ordinance
effective July 1, 1999.

A majority vote against the measure will mean that the Holtville
Utility User’s Tax will continue after November 3, 1998, as a source
of general fund revenue. A majority vote in favor of the measure will
create legal and fiscal uncertainty, and may require the proponents
of the measure or the City of Holtville to seek the assistance of the
judicial system regarding implementation, enforceability and
retroactivity of the measure.
