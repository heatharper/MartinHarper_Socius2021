CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF PROPOSITION E

PROPOSITION E proposes the formation of a City-wide Flood Control Benefit
Assessment District in accordance with the Benefit Assessment Act of 1982. This
proposed Flood Control Benefit Assessment District would provide a means to
pay for flood control improvements and services on a City-wide basis and would
eliminate the existing Drainage Maintenance Districts. The Council would be
authorized to levy an annual assessment to pay the costs of providing such facilities
and services. The first year assessments would be established by Proposition E
in an amount equal to $25 per equivalent drainage unit. By way of example, the
first year assessment for a residential property of between 6,000 square feet and
1/2 acre would be $25; an undeveloped 40 acre parcel would be $500; and a 1 acre
commercial/industrial development would be $345. The assessments for other
types of properties can be determined by reference to the Engineer’s Report on
file with the City Clerk. Revenues derived from the assessments may only be spent
for the cost of installation, improvement and maintenance of flood control
facilities.
