IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
MEASURE M

Measure M is proposed by the Dinuba City Council to continue its existing Utility Users
Tax on the November 3, 2009, Election Ballot for voter consideration. The utility users’
tax is a general tax required to be used to support local City of Dinuba services.

If approved by more than fifty percent (50%) of the voters voting in the election. Measure
M would authorize the City of Dinuba to continue its existing Utility Users’ Tax,
eliminate the sunset provision such that the tax would stay at seven percent (7%) and
ratify the existing utility users tax.

From 1993 to 2008 the State has taken over $2.5 million dollars from the City. This year
and next year they are planning to take an additional $2.6 million dollars.

Our existing UUT funds provide funding of essential city services for police, fire and
ambulance services, 9-1-1 services, after-school programs for our youth and support to
seniors. A portion of the UUT (3%) is scheduled to sunset in June of 2010. The
remaining portion (4%) is subject to legal challenge under the provisions of proposition
218 enacted in 1998.

Measure M would continue a protected revenue source to support and maintain Dinuba
city services without increasing tax levels above their current amount.

Revenues from Measure M are legally required to be used in Dinuba for essential city
services and cannot be taken by the State of California.

The tax includes a requirement for an annual financial audit performed by a qualified,
independent third party. The results of these audits would be available to the public.

Measure M also provides for modernization of the language of the code section to collect
Utility Users Taxes due to advances in modern technology in the telephone industry
including but not limited to wireless and cellular technologies.
