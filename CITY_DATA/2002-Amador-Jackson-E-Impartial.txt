lodging within the City of Jackson. It is charged by every hotel, motel and inn within the
city limits of Jackson. The residents of Jackson do not pay this tax unless they happen
to stay in one of these types of lodging facilities within the City of Jackson.

The tax generates approximately $190,000 per year. These funds are deposited into
the City’s General Fund which pays for all City services with the exception of water and
sewer. The City’s total General Fund budget for FY 2002-03 is $3.0 million.

The proposed two percent (2%) increase in the transient occupancy tax (TOT) is
intended to generate additional funding only for economic development activities. The
Jackson City Council adopted Resolution No. 2002-30 which states, “the Council hereby
declares that the first priority expenditure of the additional two percent of the transient
occupancy tax collected by the City as a result of this ballot measure shall be tourism
and business promotion, economic development and downtown revitalization.

As an assurance that the funds will be used for the specific activities listed, the resolution
further states, “Before determining the expenditure of those funds, the City shall consult
with the Chamber of Commerce, the Historic Downtown Jackson Business Association
and any other directly and beneficially interested organization within the City.”

Based on current revenues, the additional two percent transient occupancy tax will
generate approximately $47,500 per year.
