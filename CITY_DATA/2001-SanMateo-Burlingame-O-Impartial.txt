IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE O

The City Council of the City of Burlingame placed this measure on
the ballot to determine whether the increase in the transient occupancy
tax rate from 8% to 10% that was first adopted by the City in 1991 should
be continued. The transient occupancy tax is placed on the room rent
charged to hotel guests in the City of Burlingame.

The City estimates that the tax increment between 8% and 10%
generates approximately $2.8 million per year, which goes into the City’s
general fund for general government purposes, including capital
improvements, in the City. The tax is collected by hotels as part of room
bills.

Because under the proposed measure, the tax revenue would be put
into the City’s general fund for general City government purposes, a
majority vote of the City’s voters voting in this election is required to
approve the measure. Because the tax would be adopted by a vote of the
people, the tax rate could not be increased except by another vote of the
people.
