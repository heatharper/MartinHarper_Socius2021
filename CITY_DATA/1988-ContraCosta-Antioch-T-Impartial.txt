CITY ATTORNEYâ€™S ANALYSIS OF
MEASURE REGARDING MOTEL
OCCUPANCY TAX

Many California cities impose a tax upon room rates charged by hotels and motels. The tax is generally a percentage of the room charge.

Prior to March of 1986, the City of Antioch imposed a motel tax at the rate of 5 1/2% of the room charge. At that time, the City Council increased the tax to 8 1/2%.

At the November, 1986 general election, California voters approved Proposition 62, which requires voter approval of tax increases. This measure
was applied retroactively. Cities were given until the general election in 1988 to seek voter approval of such tax increases.

This measure is submitted to the voters in response to Proposition 62. A majority of those voting cast their votes in favor of the measure. The City would continue to impose a tax upon motel room rate charges of 8 1/2%. If a majority cast their votes against the measure, then the tax would be reduced to 5 1/2%. However, some trial courts have held Proposition 62 to be invalid. If the appellate courts agree, the city Council would have the option to retain the higher tax rate. 


This analysis is prepared as an impartial analysis of the measure, as required by Section 501 1 of the State Elections Code.
