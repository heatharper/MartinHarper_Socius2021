CITY ATTORNEY S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF PROPOSITION 98-C

(Admissions Tax)

The Admissions Tax is a tax on the admission price to a live sporting, athletic, theatrical or entertainment event
which occurs in the City of Inglewood. It is commonly referred to as a "visitor oriented” tax since the burden of the tax falls
on the patron of the event, often a visitor to the City. The tax has been in effect since 1972 and has been increased from
time to time.

The proposed Ordinance will establish a graduated admissions tax which will be based on the seating or crowd
capacity of the venue. Venues with a crowd capacity of 1000 or less would be exempt from the tax. The admissions tax
on venues between 1000 and 22,000 persons will remain as it is currently, i.e. 62c per admission subject to a periodic
increase based on increases in the Consumer Price Index as set forth in Inglewood Municipal Code §9-6. Venues with a
seating capacity of 22,000 or more will pay a tax equal to 10% of the admission price.

Since the City currently has no venue with a seating capacity of 22,000 or greater, and since very few taxpayers
fall within the 1000 or less category, no substantial change from current revenues would be realized by adoption of this
Ordinance. However, in the event a venue of 22,000 or greater is constructed, the admissions tax revenues for such a
facility will be imposed at the 10% rate and will result in a significant prospective increase in the total admissions tax
revenues.
