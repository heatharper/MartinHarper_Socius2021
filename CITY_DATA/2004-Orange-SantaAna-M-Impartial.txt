

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
MEASURE M


The City Council has placed on the ballot a measure seeking voter approval
to raise the City's Hotel Visitor Tax (HVT) 2% from the current rate of 9% to
11 %. Persons staying in a hotel or motel in the City for 30 days or less pay
the HVT. This measure proposes a general tax as defined by article of
the California Constitution (Proposition 218). Accordingly, it will take effect
upon approval by a majority of the Cityâ€™s voters. The revenues derived from
the HVT shall be placed in the City's general fund and may be used for any
lawful purpose by the City.
