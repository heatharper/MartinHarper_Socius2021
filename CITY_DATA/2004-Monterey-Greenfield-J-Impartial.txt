IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
CITY OF GREENFIELD
MEASUREJ

(Cal. Elections Code § 9280)

The City Council of the City of Greenfield has placed Measure
J on the November 2,2004 ballot to ask voters to consider increasing
the existing Utility Users Tax (“UUT") by three percent (3%). Measure
J would only become effective if approved by a majority of voters
casting a vote on the Measure at the November 2, 2004 election.

The City of Greenfield Municipal Code Chapter 13.50 currently
imposes a tax at the rate of three percent (3%) of the charges for
intrastate telephone, electrical, gas and cable television services
upon every person in the City of Greenfield using intrastate telephone,
electric, gas and cable television service. The revenue is used for
General Fund purposes, including police, park and recreation
services.

If approved by a majority of voters, this measure will amend
Chapter 13.50 of the Greenfield Municipal Code to increase the tax
on all of the above utilities to a rate not to exceed six percent (6%)
effective January 1, 2005 and would include an amendment making
the tax applicable to all utilities provided to residents of the City of
Greenfield.

Currently, the tax generates about $176,000 annually. This
amount is approximately 6% of the City’s general fund. These funds
are used to provide general municipal services such as police and
public works services.

By placing Measure J on the ballot, the City complies with Article
XIIIC of the California Constitution (adopted by Proposition 218),
which requires the voters to approve an amended ordinance which
affects amount of the tax, the manner of collection, and other related
matters. A copy of the proposed ordinance is printed in the sample
ballot.
