The purpose of this measure is to adopt an ordinance increasing the existing
business license tax imposed on persons engaged in the business of operating,
conducting or managing a card room in the City of Emeryville to provide for
general municipal services. Under Proposition 218, adopted in 1996, proposed
tax and fee increases must be placed on the ballot for voter approval.

Currently, the business license tax imposed on cardroom businesses is the
greater of six and one-half percent (6.5%) of gross receipts or $2,000.00 per
approved card table, paid on a quarterly basis. Under the proposed ordinance,
the business license tax imposed on cardroom businesses would be increased to the nine percent (9%) of gross receipts or per approved card table, paid on a monthly basis.

A YES vote will increase the business license tax imposed on cardroom businesses to the greater of nine percent (9%) of gross receipts or $1,000.00 per
approved card table, paid on a monthly basis.

A NO vote will not increase the business license tax imposed on cardroom
businesses; however, the present business license tax imposed on cardroom
businesses, which is the greater of six and one-half percent (6.5%) of gross
receipts or $2,000.00 per approved card table, paid on a quarterly basis, will
remain in effect.
