IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE C

CITY OF LATHROP LOCAL ONE PERCENT
TRANSACTIONS AND USE SALES TAX

Prepared by Lathrop City Attorney

This ballot measure, if approved by the voters, will generate
revenue that may be used by the City to pay for general City
operations and programs including public safety provided within
City limits for the benefit of City residents by the City or through
contract with such entities as the San Joaquin County Sheriff
Department and the Lathrop - Manteca Fire District. In addition,
the revenue generated by this measure may also be used by the
City to fund general government operations including street
maintenance and youth/senior services and programs. This ballot
measure proposes a “general purpose tax” rather than a “special
purpose tax” and therefore requires only a simple majority vote
for adoption (50% plus 1).

This ballot measure, if approved by the voters, will increase
the transactions and use sales tax rate by 1% from the current
rate 7.75% to 8.75%. The transactions and use tax increase
proposed by this ballot measure is permanent, with the one cent
increment specifically used for the local Lathrop community.

The proposed measure requires the City’s independent
auditors to complete a financial audit report to include the
revenue raised and expended by this measure. This measure
also requires an Independent Community Oversight Committee to
be established to review the expenditures of the revenue from
this transactions and use sales tax.
