MEASURE Q

This measure, if approved by the voters, would have the effect of requiring an electric power plant to pay the same utility tax, as do residents and businesses
of the City of Huntington Beach. It would operate by amending the Huntington Beach Municipal Code (the Code) to remove Section 3.36.080 (b) which
currently provides that “there shall be excluded from the base on which the tax imposed in this Section is computed: (b) Charges made for gas to be used in
the generation of electrical energy by an electrical corporation." The measure would also amend Section 3.36.010 (g) of the Code by deleting the term
“electrical corporation” from the list of definitions therein.
