CITY ATTORNEYâ€™S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS

OF PARCEL TAX MEASURE H

Contra Costa County currently provides a base library service level that allows the Orinda branch library open 29 hours a week. A parcel tax is proposed by the Orinda City Council to keep the Orinda branch library open an additional 25 hours a week. The parcel tax will also be used to replace worn and outdated books, materials, and equipment and to maintain reading and educational programs and services for children, students, adults, and seniors. The tax rate will not exceed $27.00 a year on single family residential parcels. The tax will be imposed on each family residential parcel and other equivalent unit as specified in City Council Resolution 10-01, Attachment A. The tax must be approved by two-thirds of the voters.

The amount of the proposed parcel tax will be reduced or eliminated altogether in any year when additional funds from other sources, such as matching funds from Contra Costa County, additional state funds for library operations, or a countrywide or statewide library tax, are available to support basic library services 54 hours a week and to fund desired programs, materials and equipment.

The tax if approved will be collected for 8 years, beginning July 1, 2001 and ending June 30, 2009.
