CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE K

In 1984 the City adopted Ordinance 394-84 “Telephone, Electricity and Gas
Users Tax” and amended it by Ordinance 476-93. These ordinances are now
included in the Cloverdale Municipal Code Chapter 3.90. by this legislation the
City has imposed a two percent (2%) tax on users of utility services, including
gas, electricity and telephone. The proceeds of this tax go to the City’s General
Fund services such as police, recreation and parks, and maintenance of public
streets. Over the 16 years since the tax was first adopted, a number of significant changes have taken place in the telecommunications industry.

Measure K proposes to amend the imposition of the tax in three significant
ways, If passed, it would increase the tax from two percent (2%) to five percent
(5%); it would expand the tax to include cellular, facsimile, pager and cable
video services, with account addresses within the City of Cloverdale; and
increase the cumulative dollar limitation annual cap from $250 to $350.

If Measure K fails, Cloverdale taxpayers will continue to pay tax on basic utility
services, such as electricity, gas and telephone, but not on the more modern
innovations not covered by the earlier ordinances. In addition, the City’s General
Fund will lose approximately $235,000 to $270,000 each year in revenues, and
the City Council’s ability to fund existing programs such as police, public works,
parks and streets will be substantially reduced. If Measure K is approved, the
tax will increase three percent (3%), it will be imposed on a broader number of
services, and there will remain an annual limitation on the maximum any one
user can be taxed which will increase from $250 to $350.
