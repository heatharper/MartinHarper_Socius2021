IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
MEASURE B

Cities may tax persons staying thirty (30) days or
less in hotels, motels and similar lodgings, pursuant to
California’s Revenue and Taxation Code. This type of tax
is known as a “Transient Occupancy Tax”. The Transient
Occupancy Tax has been in effect in the City of Sonora
since 1964. The current tax rate is eight percent (8%).

This measure proposes to increase the Transient
Occupancy Tax from eight percent (8%) to ten percent
(10%). If approved, the Sonora Municipal Code would
be amended to reflect the increase and the increase
would become effective on October 1,2010. In order for
the Ordinance amendment to be approved in the City
of Sonora, this measure also requires that a majority of
voters in the unincorporated area of Tuolumne County
approve a similar measure.

The proceeds from this tax may be used by the
City for general governmental purposes as defined by
Section 1, Article XIII C of the Constitution of the State of
California.
