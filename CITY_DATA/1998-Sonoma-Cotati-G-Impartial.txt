CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE G

The City of Cotati currently charges a tax of 8% of the rent charged to any person
who stays at a hotel, as defined in the Cotati Municipal Code, within the Cotati City
limits. This tax is called the transient occupancy tax (“TOT’). The TOT constitutes
a debt owed by the occupant of a hotel room to the City which is extinguished only
by payment to the hotel operator or the City. All transient occupancy taxes collected
by hotel operators are held in trust for the account of the City until payment thereof
is made to the City’s tax administrator.

If this measure is approved by the electorate, an ordinance shall be adopted
which increases the TOT. The increase equals 2% of the rent paid by persons
staying at a hotel to the hotel operator. The entire increase shall be used for
City general fund purposes.

An ordinance proposed by this ballot measure would be adopted if approved
by a simple majority of those electors voting on the measure at the November
3,1998 election.

A “yes” vote would approve an increase in the City’s TOT by 2%. A “no” vote would
reject the proposed 2% increase in the City’s TOT.
