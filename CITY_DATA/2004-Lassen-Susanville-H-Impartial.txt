IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS FOR MEASURE H

Present law within the City of Susanville provides that each transient,
traveler or guest who stays at a hotel, motel, or recreational vehicle
(RV) park within the city limits of Susanville must pay a tax on the amount
of rent charged by the operator of the hotel or motel or RV park. This is
called a Transient Occupancy Tax, or TOT. The TOT presently in effect
in the City of Susanville is at the rate of eight percent (8%). This rate
has been in effect since 1989. The tax is collected by the owner or
operator of the hotel, motel or RV park, and turned over to the City of
Susanville, usually quarterly.

This measure seeks to amend Section 4.30.404 of the Susanville
Municipal Code to increase the Transient Occupancy Tax (TOT to ten
percent (10%, effective as of July 1, 2004.

Approval of this measure will increase the TOT rate within the City of
Susanville from eight percent (8%) to ten percent (10%), effective July
1,2004.

Failure of this measure will result in no increase in the TOT rate within
the City of Susanville, and the TOT within the City of Susanville will
remain at eight percent (8%).

A general tax, such as the Transient Occupancy Tax, requires a majority
vote and is imposed for general governmental purposes.

To be approved, this measure must receive the favorable vote of at
least a majority of the voters voting on it.
