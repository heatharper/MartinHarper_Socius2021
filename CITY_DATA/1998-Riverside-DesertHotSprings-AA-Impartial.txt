IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE “AA"

Measure “AA” is submitted by the City Council for voter approval of
Resolution No, 1998-25. Measure “AA" will extend the existing City of
Desert Hot Springs Utility Users Tax of 3% beyond June 30,1999, The
City now collects over $400,000 in annual revenues from the Utility
Users Tax,

Measure “AA” is a general tax, and revenues collected under
Measure “AA” will be used to pay for the cost of general city operations,
including police protection, fire services, community safety (including
crossing guards), senior services, animal control, code enforcement and
the like.

The Utility Users Tax imposes a 3% tax on electricity, gas, telephone
services and cable television sendees. The maximum rate of taxation
which may be imposed on these services is 5%. The City Council must
review the taxation rate annually.

The Utility Users Tax currently contains an expiration date of June
30,1999. If Measure “AA" is approved by a majority vote, the existing 3%
utility user tax on electricity, gas, telephone services and cable television
services will be applied to utility bills after June 30,1999. The tax will be
collected by the utility companies from each customer and then paid to
the City.

If Measure “AA” is not approved, the resulting loss of revenue may
require a cutback in services such as police protection and fire services.

When the City Council adopted this tax in 1993, it was permitted to

approve such general taxes without a vote of the electorate. The
passage of a statewide ballot measure in November, 1996, requires that

the imposition or extension of, or increase in, any general tax be submit-
ted to the electorate for approval.

Voting “YES” for Measure “AA”
means:

The voter approves the collection of the existing 3% utility users Tax.

Voting “NO” for Measure “AA”
means:

The voter wants the existing utility user tax to end.
