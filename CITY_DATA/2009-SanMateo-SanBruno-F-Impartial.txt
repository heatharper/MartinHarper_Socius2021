IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF MEASURE F

Measure F is a proposal to increase the City of San Bruno’s existing
Transient Occupancy Tax from 10% to 12%. Transient Occupancy Taxes,
which exist in many cities in California, impose a tax on guests staying at
any hotel or similar establishment within the city’s borders. Each guest
must pay the tax on the amount of rent charged by the operator of the hotel
or similar establishment. A full copy of Measure F is printed in these ballot
materials.

The City’s Transient Occupancy Tax rate is currently 10%. The City
Council last increased the Transient Occupancy Tax from 8% to 10% in
1991, and the voters affirmed the rate in 2001.

State law authorizes the City of San Bruno to levy this tax if approved
both by two-thirds of the City Council and by a majority of the voters voting
in an election on the proposal. The San Bruno City Council unanimously
approved the proposed tax increase to 12% on July 14, 2009. Several
neighboring cities are placing similar measures on the November 3, 2009
ballot to increase their Transient Occupancy Tax rates from 10% to 12%.

The Transient Occupancy Tax is a general tax and as such requires
a majority vote and is imposed for general governmental purposes. All
proceeds from the tax would be deposited in the City’s general fund and
could be used for any general municipal purposes, such as police and fire
protection, library services, public works, parks and recreation, and other
governmental functions and services.

The City’s revenue in 2008-09 from the Transient Occupancy Tax was
$1,225,000. If hotel usage and rents remained similar in the future, the
2% increase in the Transient Occupancy Tax would generate approximately
$270,000 in additional general fund revenue in future years. The actual
amount collected would depend on hotel usage and room rates. Planned
general fund expenditures were reduced for the 2009-10 fiscal year
by $2,500,000 to offset a projected reduction in revenues of the same
amount.

If Measure F is approved by a majority of the voters at the November
3, 2009 election, the 2% increase would be imposed starting on January 1,
2010.

A YES vote approves the measure.

A NO vote rejects the measure.
