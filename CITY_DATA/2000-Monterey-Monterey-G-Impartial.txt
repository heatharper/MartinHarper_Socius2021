

IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
CITY OF MONTEREY MEASURE G

This proposed Charter amendment was unanimously approved by
the Monterey City Council and has qualified for presentation to the
voters at the November 7, 2000 election.

The effect of this amendment if adopted by the voters would be to
require that before selling, transferring, or rezoning any City-owned
open space lands in the coastal areas, the City Council would first
have to secure approval through a vote of the people.

The measure would still afford future City Councils the ability to
exercise some discretion with respect to use of these lands, but without
permitting any conveyance of the land or change in zoning category
without first obtaining approval from a majority vote of the electorate.

This measure would only apply to City lands, not those held by
private individuals or other government agencies, and it would apply
automatically in the future to any City property in this area zoned
"0â€œ if acquired by the City or if City-owned lands in this area were
rezoned to "0".

If adopted by the voters, the new provisions could not be changed
except by a vote of the electorate or by a court finding the provision,
or any part of it, to be improper.
