CITY OF PISMO BEACH
CITY ATTORNEY’S IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS FOR
MEASURE C

If approved by the voters, Measure C entitled “The Pismo Beach Vital
Public Service Protection Measure”, would amend the Pismo Beach Municipal
Code to establish a retail transactions and use tax within the City, as authorized
by the State Legislature under Revenue and Taxation Code Section 7285.9. This
measure would set the retail transactions and use tax rate at one-half of one
percent (0.50%). At this rate, for example, a retail transaction $100 in value
would generate a tax of 50 cents. The proposed transactions and use tax would
be imposed upon the sale of all tangible personal property sold at retail within the
City. This measure would authorize the City to enter into a contract with the State
Board Of Equalization to administer and collect the tax.

This measure requires all proceeds of the tax to be deposited into the City’s
General Fund to be used for such general municipal governmental purposes as
the City Council shall direct. Among such purposes are street and sidewalk
construction, maintenance and repair, pothole repair, storm drain construction,
maintenance and repair, and pier maintenance.

This measure would provide several enumerated exemptions and exclusions
from the transactions and use tax. It would further prohibit the issuance of any
injunction to prohibit the collection of the tax. The ordinance proposed by this
measure will only become effective if approved by a majority of those electors
voting on the measure. The measure provides that, if approved at election, the
tax would expire six and one-half years following its operative date without further
action of the City Council or the voters. The measure would also provide for
semi-annual reports to the City Council of the amounts collected and the
purposes to which the amounts collected were put.

A YES vote approves the measure.

A NO vote rejects the measure.
