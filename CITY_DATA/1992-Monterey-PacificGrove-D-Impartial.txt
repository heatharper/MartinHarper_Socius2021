IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS BY CITY ATTORNEY
CITY OF PACIFIC GROVE TRANSIENT OCCUPANCY
TAX INCREASE MEASURE D

Measure D, if approved by two-thirds of the voters voting on the measure,
would permit the City of Pacific Grove to increase its transient occupancy
tax from the present rate of 10% to a new rate of 11%. The transient
occupancy tax is a tax on the rent paid for the privilege of occupying a
room or rooms in a hotel, motel or other similar type lodging for a period
of 30 days or less. If the measure is approved, the increase in the transient
occupancy tax would be authorized for a period not to exceed ten years,
beginning the first calendar year after approval by the voters. The measure
requires that the money collected as a result of the additional tax of 1 %
of the rent charged be used solely to assist in financing the acquisition and
restoration of ail or any part of the shoreline area known as Rocky Shores,
for the purpose of preserving the Rocky Shores area as public open space.
The measure provides that the City Council may utilize any appropriate financing method to fund the acquisition of Rocky Shores, provided that the
amount financed shall not exceed the capability of the additional one percent
of transient occupancy tax to fund the payment of principal, interest and
administrative costs of the amount financed. If the Rocky Shores property
becomes owned entirely by a public entity, if the City of Pacific Grove owes
no debt in connection with the acquisition and if in the judgment of the
City Council of the City of Pacific Grove the restoration of the Rocky Shores
area is sufficient for use as a public open space, then the City Council is
required to rescind the additional 1 % transient occupancy tax even if the
ten year period authorized by the measure has not ended.
