MEASURE EE

PROPOSED MODIFICATION TO THE PARAMEDIC
ADVANCED LIFE SUPPORT FIRE ENGINES
AMBULANCE SPECIAL TAX, SECTION 4-8.10 ET
SEQ. OF THE ALBANY MUNICIPAL CODE

A “Yes” vote would authorize the City Council to
adjust the Advanced Live Support Fire Engine and Ambulance special tax by 4% per year commencing in fiscal
year 2010-2011.

A “No” vote would reject an amendment to Chapter 4-8 of the Albany Municipal Code allowing the City Council
to adjust the tax by 4% per year starting in fiscal year
2010-2011.

This is a special tax and requires a 2/3 approval of the
voters voting.

Background

In 2000, the voters approved a special tax to support
the costs of a program for advanced life support for fire
engines, ambulances, and credentialed employees. The tax
is imposed as a parcel tax. The average residential parcel
pays $18.00 per year. At the time this tax was approved,
the ordinance contained no provision for adjusting this
amount to reflect cost of living increases. The tax has not
been adjusted since its inception.

Proposed Modification

If approved, commencing fiscal year 2010 - 2011, the
City Council could increase the base tax by 4% per year.
Fiscal Impact

If passed, a single family residential property’s tax
would increase by about $0.72 per year. Over a ten year
period, the increase would average 870 per year. A commercial property currently paying $200.00 per year in tax
would increase by $8.00 per year.
